Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.<br /><br />Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner	2005-10-14

My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.<br /><br />It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.<br /><br />The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days.	2005-10-14

This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surprised however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.	2005-10-14

I would say that it is one of the best books that I have ever read. It is very exciting and I enjoyed the mystery that was in the story. This is one of the most adventurous books that I have ever read.  <br /> <br />This book is about a ten year old girl, Isabella Zophie, who finds the Locket of Fire and Water in her great aunt's house and when she puts it on she is transported to another world - Zartarbia. She meets a circus which has lots of great characters including Mr Krock O'Dile who is a crocodile that runs the circus.  Isabella is chased by one of the syndicate, Mistress Sectica.  The Syndicate are a group of villains who are trying to control Zartarbia.  Fighting against the syndicate is the Federation Against Dark Forces (FADF) with agents trained in some of the coolest fighting techniques.   <br /> <br />Zartarbia is a magical world where nothing is as it seems. There is a crazy character called the Thinker who is a complete lunatic and very funny.  The first chapter is a bit confusing but you need to keep reading as it is important for later in the book.  <br /> <br />I think that all genders will like this book. Some parts in this book are very funny. If you are interested in fantasy and adventure, then you will enjoy this book.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to anyone.  <br />	2005-10-14

The book covers facts regarding the history of the organization Habitat for Humanity and the author's experiences volunteering. Goodrich writes about the places, the people, and the volunteers he has encountered during his five-year experience with Habitat for Humanity. The author speaks straight from the heart, some of which brought tears to my eyes, some of sadness, some of laughter. Even through all the heart-wrenching sights, Goodrich and his crew persevere, regardless of the obstacles they face. Goodrich's experiences include traveling around the world, from America to London from London to Paraguay even getting lost in the Sierra, Faith is a Verb, is a fantastic read. In addition, the book opens a person's eyes and heart to the devastation and suffering that many see everyday of their lives. The book puts into perspective just how lucky we are even though we may not think so; it made me not only look at my ethics and values but also encouraged me to pick up that hammer.	2005-10-14

In a not too distant future, Angel is a certified Retribution Specialist (CRS), which means that when the law fails to bring justice, the victims can hire a CRS to bring in the perpetrator of the crime to them to enact their own justice.  When a closed case is reopened, Angel is again under investigation for \\"what happened\\" the night policeman Danny Black died.  On top of dealing with this, her mother, Lola, gets kidnapped, and Angel knows that if she doesn't rescue Lola herself, she might die. <br /> <br />Because she has Detective Marco following her and questioning her movements - from the past as well as during the events he witnesses personally, she starts finding things out about herself she really didn't want to know...like her exceptionally good luck.  It may not be luck after all; the physic abilities Lola has may actually be genuine and she inherited them.  <br /> <br />KISS OF THE BLUE DRAGON is the second story I've read by Julie Beard, and I actually like her writing style better here.  The story is written in first person, which can drive readers batty (me too upon occasion); however, it works here.  There is a different \\"feel\\" to KISS completely.  For me, I can \\"hear\\" a narrator filling in the details of Angels' activities.  So even though we, as a reader, only get to know her thoughts and impressions of what she sees, we still get to know what is going on around her.  You get to know Angel, what motivates her and see how she thinks very well.  I also really liked the fact that a lot of simple details of her life are included. <br />  <br />I will admit it was a close call as to whether I would like Angel or not.  She almost doesn't seem feminine.  However, if you read a little further into the book, you learn what her logic is, how she thinks but more importantly WHY.  Angel is tough, spunky, kick-butt heroine and out to help those unable to help themselves.  She is fearless and makes her decisions based on what is right rather than whether she willget hurt or not.  Angel is one busy lady.  She has cases that she maintains during the process of rescuing Lola and I liked the fact that Julie Beard didn't drop some of these issues, therefore the story stays three dimensional.   <br /> <br />While the reopened investigation is secondary to what is going on in her life, it is what brings our hero and heroine together.  I was happy with the chemistry between her and Detective Marco even if the bedroom scenes take place off of the books pages.   <br /> <br />I like the fact that even though KISS is a science-fiction romance, the author doesn't go out of her way to create objects that will stump the reader, or throw off the flow of the novel.  For an example: in a time where DNA left behind is what would keep you in jail, rather than using a hollow-tip bullet, a criminal would use a bullet filled with acid therefore destroying the evidence.   <br /> <br />KISS is technically supposed to be a romance, but with the way this story ends, we don't have our heroine hooking up with the hero.  Because Lola was kidnapped by one of the Chicago mobs there are still some unresolved issues that its sequel might wrap up.  Regardless, I didn't feel like major details were left out or the story wasn't well developed.  As a reader I didn't find myself wondering, \\"what just happened\\"?   <br /> <br />I found KISS OF THE BLUE DRAGON very interesting, and look forward to reading the further adventures of Angel in its sequel TOUCH OF THE WHITE TIGER.  So, if you are looking for something a little different, check out this story!	2005-10-14

He takes a trip around the world to see what people and their different cultures are like. Even though he was in love with sailing, he did not really know the dangerous things that could happen to him while he was on his adventure. The protagonist of the story is obviously the boy(Robin Graham, because he was the main character. For the theme of this story, I would say that \\" Dont judge a book by its cover\\", would be one that makes a lot of sense. Another book that I would also reccomend would be Maiden Voyage, by Tania Aebi. This is what I thought about the book \\" Dove.\\" Once again, it was a great read.	2005-10-14

Being a stalwart fan of the fantasy genre I decided to put my skepticism aside, break down and give these \\"children's\\" books a go. This series is in line with a lot of classic entertainment touted as \\"children's\\" fare (e.g., original Bugs Bunny cartoons, The Hobbit, Chronicles of Narnia, among others): that is, much of it is aimed straight at the heart of adults. And it hits the mark.    I have finished the series up to Book Five and I must say that there have been some pretty grisly incidents for younger readers. However, one can assume that many of Rowling's younger readers have followed the books from the beginning, and grown as Harry Potter did. For the younger readers just starting, however, along about book four some of the material may be a tad startling or disconcerting.    In any case, I have found the writing to be thoroughly entertaining, particularly the effective use of tongue-in-cheek humor. There is a comical brattiness about many of the characters (professors, parents, and students alike) which plays pretty well. The childishness of the main characters can be a bit trying at times, I will admit; but it is forgivable and understandable...they are, after all, still kids.    The use of suggestion and mystery -- of questions that do not get answered till the end of the book -- can also be a bit trying at times, but it is also compelling and intriguing at the same time, and part of this author's trademark.    All in all, these are exciting, fast-paced books, truly classics in their own time, and I am duly impressed that they lived up to their hype in my mind, skeptic that I was. Five stars, for cripe's sake.	2005-10-14

Eight years later she remains independent running her estate until her mother informs her she must marry so that an heir can inherit Friarsgate.<br /><br />Her beloved sixty years old Uncle Thomas agrees to escort the feisty landowner to court.  However, before they leave for London, Baen MacColl comes from Scotland at the behest of his father to discus a sheep deal.  As the two die in the wool anti-marital soul mates fall in love, Elizabeth chaperoned by her uncle travels to the king's court.  There she befriends the beleaguered queen while Henry VIII begins his campaign to replace his wife Katherine with Anne.<br /><br />The key to this battle between two independent obstinate loving combatants is the background that incorporates Henry's antics as he sets in motion his plan to remove Katherine of Aragon as queen and replace her with Anne Boleyn.  Bertrice Small cleverly uses the monumental sixteenth century events to tell her story of love yet in some ways the shadow overwhelms the lead characters.  Fans of historical romance with strong doses of both will enjoy the latest Meredith tale (see UNTIL YOU AND PHILIPPA).<br /><br />Harriet Klausner	2005-10-14

She visits his property to learn he has been gone for about a week.  Inside his dying plants show he has not been there.<br /><br />Worse a stranger is residing in Daniel's house insisting that he is a nephew interested in his family tree.  However, as the residences on Creek Road suffer a rash of odd break-ins, Emily notices that Matthew is paying more attention to her and her parents than the Rutherford family.  Emily wonders is he really a relative of her neighbor or is he the B&E bandit?  Regardless, she knows from the moment their eyes saw one another, something inside her heart clicked.<br /><br />The sequel to THE HOUSE ON CREEK ROAD is a fine romantic suspense thriller as Emily wonders whether her heart has betrayed her since the stranger seems to be \\"investigating\\" her family not his as he claims.  Matthew finds the conflict of interest even more difficult as he hides why he is in town from the woman he has fallen in love with though they hardly know one another.  The romance is perhaps too fast yet seems right as it adds conflict between the two wannabe lovers.  Fans will want to travel down THE WINTER ROAD.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner	2005-10-14

He is too ugly and broke to be able to seduce women and leave them feeling used.  I got this book from the library because as a single gal I thought that I would learn something about men,  the kind who charm,  seduce,  and destroy.  Well,  what I learned is that Rick Marin is just a talentless guy trying to pass himself off as an intropesctive writer-wannabe poser.  It's amazing that Marin got any girls to date him taking into consideration how cold and judgmental he is. Reading his book was like watching a car accident--you know it's better to control yourself but you keeping looking to see the blood and guts.  Well,  this book just shows that this guy,  who has really nothing special,  or even redeemable,  is striving to be funny, intellectual, and show the male perspective on dating. He comes off really shallow,  superficial,  and as though he doesn't care which girl he's with as long as he's not alone.  Read it for yourself--Marin has nothing new or interesting to write. In this day and age,  anyone can publish regardless of whether or not the writer has anything significant to write about.	2005-10-14

My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.<br /><br />It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.<br /><br />The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days.	2005-10-14

Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.<br /><br />Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner	2005-10-14

He then goes into their relationship, how it came to be, and the affect it had on their great works of literature. The books influenced by their time together, Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Grant's Personal Memoirs, are considered to be classics and the best that either of the authors ever produced.  In fact, some think that Huckleberry Finn is the best American novel ever, and that Personal Memoirs (about the Mexican and Civil Wars) is the best American book ever written on military events.   Perry records many conversations Grant and Twain had with each other and with the other folks surrounding them, including families and associates.  It makes you feel like you are there, and gives some personal insight into what these gentlemen were really like. We find that they were both quite remarkable as private figures as well as public figures. The story of their relationship rides to a great extent on the heroic drama of Grant racing to finish his book before dying of cancer, to ensure the financial security of his family.  Perry, at the same time, paints a fascinating sketch of what Twain called the Gilded Age, a time of great industrial progress along with great corruption in the U.S. <br /> <br />It was a thoroughly enjoyable read. <br />	2005-10-14

We get to see a side of Adams that is deeply concerned with the plight of the beautiful, unique, and often ludicrously implausible lifeforms on our planet -- the same side that prompted him to climb Mount Kilimanjaro in a rhino suit.     What made this book all the more meaningful to me was that I'd thought I'd finished all of Douglas Adams' books long ago. I loved them all, but I never fully appreciated the depth of his genius as a humanist and social satirist until, sadly, he had passed away.  What's more, I never realized how much Adams' writings meant to me until I was hit with the cold, hard reality that he'd written all he ever would.  Douglas Adams had hitched his last ride across the galaxy, and I'd never hear from him again.  Or so I thought.    Infinitely improbable as it may seem, I heard from Douglas Adams again about two weeks ago.  I was browsing around in Borders, long since resigned to the fact that I'd read the last \\"new\\" Douglas Adams book I ever would, when I stumbled upon \\"Last Chance to See.\\" I felt like I'd gone into the pet store to buy a parakeet and, instead, found a dodo bird.      The endangered species Douglas Adams criss-crossed the globe in search of are all, in their own ways, remarkable and priceless. He urges us not to wait until they're gone to fully appreciate them, and he drives this point home to today's readers, in his own ironic style, by now being himself \\"extinct.\\"    If you're a Douglas Adams fan, and you've never read this book, here it is -- your own \\"last chance to see\\" (or, rather, read) him.  His own voice, his own words, his own experiences.  For me, it was a fond farewell from an old friend I'd never met, who, from his new home -- far beyond life, the universe, and everything -- telling me, \\"Yes, I'm dead. But there are still a few rhinos and gorillas and dolphins that aren't. Do me a favor; make sure they stay that way.\\"	2005-10-14

I did not like the idea that instead of Tarl Cabot we were now telling the story of a different Earth man who ends up on Gor, although the Jason Marshall trilogy was more interesting to me than the story of Judy Thornton, a woman brought to Gor as a captive in \\"Slave Girl of Gor.\\"  In the first volume of the trilogy, \\"Fighting Slave of Gor,\\" Marshall ends up on Gor when he tries to save Beverly Henderson from a Gorean slave trap.  The next thing the civilized Earth man knows he is a slave on Gor.  Starting out as the silk slave of the Lady Florence of Vonda, Marshall then becomes a Gorean gladiator, which gives him the opportunity to become free so that he can find Beverly, who now also a slave on Gor.<br /><br />\\"Rogue of Gor\\" is the middle volume in the trilogy and the novel and has Marshall searching for Beverly.  But since this is a trilogy you know that he is not going to find her until the final volume, \\"Guardsman of Gor.\\"  Instead, Marshall travels along the River Vosk to the port city of Victoria, north of Port Kar, and finds himself in the middle of a war between Glorious Ar and the Salerian Confederation as the pirate fleet seeks to control the waterways of Gor on which the cities are so dependent.  In terms of providing more action than sex, this is the one volume of the trilogy that delivers on that score and if you are waiting for Jason and Beverly to consummate their relationship in Gorean terms you have the last half of the next novel for all of that to play out (after a giant naval battle).  In this one he finds her on the slaver's block, buys her, and sets her free even though she insists she is a true slave and therefore does not desire freedom.<br /><br />There is a sense in which Norman is trying to get back to the basics, since the fight between Ar and the Salerian Confederation is not, at face value, part of the gigantic struggle between the Priest-Kings and the Kurii.  But the sexual philosophy of Gor is now becoming the dominant theme of Norman's stories.  The back of the original paperback declares, \\"Jason Marshall learned the meaning of manhood and the power of women, both dominant and submissive\\" on Gor, but clearly he has yet to fully accept his role in this society.  This time around Norman is educating a male rather than a female, which is usually the case in the Gor novels, and I think that you have to take such instruction at face value.<br /><br />The obvious assumption might be that most men would not need to be persuaded to live a life being a master, but when you consider the discussion that Jason and Beverly were having at the start of the trilogy before they ended up on Gor you have to admit that it is not exactly the sort of lifestyle to which a \\"civilized\\" man would aspire.  Clearly Norman is arguing men have to be carefully taught such beliefs almost as much as women, although you will never convince me the male of the species would require as much persuasion.  Consequently, whether you judge \\"Rogue of Gor\\" by the standard of either the best Gor adventures (\\"Nomads of Gor\\" and \\"Assassins of Gor\\") or the main testaments of Gorean sexuality (\\"Slave Girl of Gor,\\" \\"Kajira of Gor,\\" and \\"Dancing Girl of Gor\\"), it falls short.

Politics has a role as well, and he must address the inherent contradictions within the Capitalist system that encourages capital accumulation, flight and waste. All in all and interesting read from an \\"insider\\"...if you are looking for alternatives to the \\"Washington Consensus\\" then this is not your book. This book mainly advocates tweeking the international system (IMF, World bank, UN) to help alleviate poverty (which has political as well as economic reasons) but not changing it per se. I would have hoped that he would have taken on more the Capitalist world system and its predictable modern expression of it and its future trajectory.	2005-10-14

Lucent's down fall started with the 1984 decree. Something that AT&T embraced thinking that new and bigger markets would be available. Missteps included buying TCI cable without the experience and knowledge of running a mom and pop business on the run far from \\"Bell Standards\\" that so many Western Electric and Lucent Managers embraced. They did not change into the flexible and savy business men of the 80s and 90s and lost at every turn and decission. The \\"Early Outs\\" prior to 1991 took most of the business knowledge and stability with them. Managers and CEOs were hired from all differnt kinds of Companies having differnt values and business understandings (which was needed) but lacked fundamental telecommunications expertise and how to gain a lion's share of the market. The best method was new technologies coupled with listening to all the customers needs and concerns. Lucent, like its predecessor and parent company, devalued it's stock and undevalued it's once talented, dedicated and loyal workforce. The Book seems like a good purchase but it doesn't seem to touch upon the employees who built it and subsequently were forced to see it go. Bell Labs and the Bell System literally dictated to the Baby Bells that analog equipment would continue to be used in the late 70s. Digital technology had been introduced by various venders and Bell Labs played \\"catch up\\" when the operating companies began buying the digital equipment fron non Western Electric sources. That was the first mis-step of Western Electric....Lucent Technologies management. Understand the marketplace and the needs of your customer...always. R.

The reasons are manifest.  Villainous Lens Larque provides some of the best challenges and intimidation for our hero, Kirth Gersen.  There's the usual helping of exquisite writing and fine descriptions; the menu items during Gersen's restraunt visits are particularly noteworthy.  Most importantly, \\"The Face\\" is the most morally challenging novel in the series.  It presents, to some extent, the best argument for Gersen abandoning his single-minded hunt for revenge in his abortive attempts at romance with two characters.  Lastly, \\"The Face\\" has a killer ending, laugh-out-loud serious if there ever was such a thing. <br /> <br />Another notable element is the planet Dar Sai and its inhabitants, the Darsh.  Dar Sai is odd even by Vance standards.  Giant umbrellas of water protect folks from searing daytime heat, the women grow mustaches, food is prized for its repulsiveness and gender wars are taken to a whole new level.  Vance scores particular points by showing us the spoiled tourists who visit solely to mock the backwards Darsh.  An just dessert is served for them at the end, of course. <br /> <br />The last novel in the series, \\"The Book of Dreams\\", is competent but less biting than \\"The Face\\".  The new villain, Howard Alan Treesong, is less impressively hateable than Lens Larque or Viole Falshune from \\"The Palace of Love\\".  \\"The Book of Dreams\\" contains vignettes set on numerous planets, none of them particuarly brilliant.  The best parts of this novel are the introductory segments to each chapter.  Short paragraphs cover a wide range of ground, from the hilarious philosophical basis of the Institute to the stunning character introductions for Treesong's various Paladins.	2005-10-14

But after reading the Fiery Cross, I was a bit let down, as many people were, and afraid that the rest of the series would just continue to go downhill.  So when A Breath of Snow and Ashes came out, I was so glad to see that it was getting good reviews.  I finally got to read it this week and was not disappointed in the least. <br />All the characters we know and love are back, and Brianna seems to have finally grow up.  She has been my least favorite character since the second book, but this time around she was actually likeable (for the most part).  At certain points this book became so intense that I actually had to put it down and take a break for awhile, but not all readers will have this experience, only ones that are practically obsessed with this series (and who's friends have to remind them, \\"Jamie is NOT a real person!).    <br />So basically, if you have read the previous books, just read this one. Please.  You won't regret it.  The only reason I didn't give this one five stars is that I think nothing can top Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber.  If I could give this 4.5, I would. <br /> <br />One thing I have wondered about - if Claire dies back in the 1700's, then she'll be born again in 1918, go back in time in 1946, die in the 1700's, be born in 1918, and just keep repeating this forever.

Word to the wise. The Magic of Christmas is identical to Christmas Unwrapped and the X-mas Files by the same author. The publisher, for some unknown and absurd reason, republished this book under three different titles with three different publication dates.  <br /> <br />The overall theme of the book is excellent for showing the Amanita muscaria mushroom/shamanic origins of the Christmas story and even goes into some archaeoastronomy.  <br /> <br />Much of this same information has been revealed by James Arthur in Mushrooms and Mankind and by James Bursenos in The Resurrection of Santa Claus - (republished) Shaman's Drum Issue 68, 2005. Dr. Harding was probably the first to discover the information, and probably the last to go to print with it. James Arthur (2000) uses many of the same associations in his book (with no references - plagiarism?) and radio shows that he very likely took \\"some\\" material from Harding. Harding's book(s) are far better and more readable than James Highfield - The Physics of Christmas (1998), etc., which bases much of the work on Harding, though strays off numerous times into unrelated material. <br /> <br />However, save your money and only buy one of the 3 different versions of the book. I'm glad I needed extra Christmas presents, but I was actually looking forward to reading \\"further\\" research by Dr. Harding, not the same book under three different titles. I'm very disappointed in the deceptive tactics of his publisher not informing the public that they're all the same damn book. They don't even appear to be different editions. Same material, same page numbers, same everything page for page.  <br /> <br />Buy it, but only buy one.	2005-10-14

This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surprised however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.	2005-10-14

However, Elizabeth Brownstein does. Through careful and thorough research, Ms. Brownstein addresses issues hitherto unexplored. Lincoln's summer home...provides a suitable setting to describe Lincoln's activities outside the White House.  One learns, for instance, that the first draft of the Emancipation Proclamation was completed here. One also learns that, far from being a retreat from the hustle and bustle of Pennsylvania Avenue, the home facilitated Lincoln's open-mindedness about receiving virtual strangers at virtually any hour of the day or night and resulted in serious sleep deprivation.  <br /> <br />However, it was in the other topics addressed in the book that Lincoln's character is at its most illuminating. His fascination with weaponry, his patience in his dealings with his wife, and his ability to establish collegial relationship with people of vastly differing temperaments are all thoughtfully explored...The characters highlighted are dispassionately analyzed in such a way as to enable the reader to be part of the scene at all times.  For instance, Lincoln's wife, so often pilloried...is given a fair hearing and is properly depicted as a courageous soul confronted by agonizing choices and exaggerated expectations of the First Lady's performance as a suitable consort of the most admired President in American History...Mrs. Brownstein provides a valuable service for readers interested in the less dramatic, but no less insightful, clues about Lincoln the President, confronted, as he was, by the unprecedented challenges associated with his era. <br />	2005-10-14

As a student at a university driven by both scholarly research and the party scene, I can picture many of the novel's more dramatic scenes.  Some, like the Saint Ray party toward the beginning or the intimidating neuroscience lecture hall, I felt as if i were remembering rather than reading.   <br /> <br />No, there is no university quite like Dupont, succeeding in academics and sports at the highest levels.  If he had not given the school these characteristics, however, Wolfe might have put himself at a disadvantage:  There would be less of a chance for a reader to identify with the university, the characters, the scenes, and his commentary would have been limited to fewer aspects of today's campuses.  A novel about an UNDERachieving university might be interesting as well, but I think the scope of I Am Charlotte Simmons, and Dupont in particular, was well suited to Wolfe's acute powers of observation.	2005-10-14

It adds some great insight by several of the world's best known nature photographers.  Any book that has instructional information from John Shaw, Arthur Morris, Charles Glatzer, and Joe McDonald is well worth the investment. <br /> <br />One of the most difficult aspects of PhotoShop for me has been the effective use of curves.  Tim and Ellen do a much better job at helping with this complex matter than any other book I have read. <br /> <br />The effective utilization of PhotoShop requires as much of an artistic approach as it does as workflow approach.  Tim and Ellen do a very good job of fully developing a great workflow while introducing their own artistic approach. <br /> <br />No one book can every include all the aspects of PhotoShop that you will every need.  However, \\"Photoshop for Nature Photographers : A Workshop in a Book\\" does a great job of specilizing for nature photographers.  As with any workshop, it does require the student to do some work to get the most out of the class. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to any nature photographer who would like to improve their utilization and knowledge of PhotoShop. <br />	2005-10-14

But if you have read and enjoyed works such as the first two volumes of \\"Roots of Strategy\\", you should have no trouble following this book.    The author successfully shows that military personnel have mixed feelings about war.  Although he addresses behavior in the midst of battle, the author seems more interested in the views about war held by those outside war itself, i.e., those who had not yet experienced it and those who were looking backward in retrospect.  How those people felt in the midst of the madness is almost certainly different from how they anticipated or how they adjusted their feelings afterwards.  I think this \\"flavor\\" derives from his personal-interview-and-historical-research approach.  I do not see this as a negative but rather staying within his scope of knowledge and expertise.    The review titled \\"Flawed work of a historian with no sociological credibility\\" seems too harshly critical.  Perhaps this reviewer expected a highly technical, in-depth psychological approach.  As a note: page 58 cites S.L.A. Marshall as stating that only \\"some 15 per cent of American infantrymen fired.\\"  True, the subject of women in the military is barely broached.  However, in all fairness, the author never pretends to have extensive knowledge about how women react in battle and simply doesn't go there.  Perhaps that is a deficiency of character, but not of the book.  I get the feeling that this review didn't find what he wanted and then \\"skimmed\\" the book without thinking into what was being presented.      Although now much more interested in peace studies, I enjoyed reading this book.  I found a number of passages that shed light on where I have been and where I seek to go.  I don't see this as a pro-military book although at times it may seem so.  I characterize it as an honest endeavor to address and understand some of the difficult questions that most of us have concerning death and killing in war-time.	2005-10-14

While I don't always agree with his TV analysis, I enjoy Mr. Crawford's commentaries. His book, however, is surprisingly shallow and can be summed up in one chapter with footnotes. I didn't realize an intentional misquoting of Thomas Jefferson on page 2 (easy enough to catch as the footnote provides the actual quote) was a foreshadowing of the paraphrasing to come. Almost all his sources are the very media he criticizes.    Yes, the media should be astute and critical of anyone in power anywhere, yet it isn't, mostly because it has been corporatized. vilified and because reporters and organizations have wimped out. OK, yes, and....?     Since Crawford is a journalist, one who claims an inside view of what really goes on, he is obligated by the same standards he poses not just to say this is what went on, but to explain why manipulation is allowed and what to do about it. Tom Fenton in his book, Bad News, does a more thorough job of explaining the links between money and reporting and providing a context for media manipulation and journalistic reticence.     Crawford gives specific examples of manipulation, but doesn't provide motive or context beyond the trite \\"politicians manipulate the media so they can look better so they can become powerful.\\" Therein lies the point, if the media is powerful enough that it needs to be manipulated, then it is powerful enough to hold its own. Why hasn't the media held its own and why aren't people demanding a real public discussion? What does the messenger do with the message he was supposed to deliver?    Crawford says people are tuning to outlets to verify their beliefs so news outlets are becoming customer-driven reinforcing agents. If that's true, why is the media making that choice instead of taking the lead? Politicians do attack the messenger, but often they don't have to, because the messenger has been co-opted. More dangerously, by giving hyperbole public time and space, the news media cuts its own throat then calls it a tracheotomy.    Still, despite the flaws, I stayed with the book's limited scope until page 117. \\"I don't vote....\\" With that, Crawford's credibility flew out the window.     \\"I fear it will make it more difficult to keep my observations down the middle.\\" After 116 pages of caterwalling about professional and personal responsibility, about the consequences to democracy of a media manipulated by power, about how the media is responsible to its constituents, the public, and should judge both the quality and importance of its \\"message,\\" Crawford absolves himself of any duty, responsibility or personal judgment. His book becomes a version of \\"do as I say, not as I do.\\" Worse yet, the core of his argument is a tautology: journalists must give up the rights and responsibilities of citizenship to uphold the rights and responsibilitites of citizenship. Talk about attacking the messenger, the messenger just committed suicide.     Come on, get in the muck with the rest of us, make tough decisions, make judgments. It's in the choosing that one gains perspective and insight. Not voting because you're a journalist is like saying a Yankee fan can't write about baseball or deciding not to eat anything, ever, so no one will know you don't like brocolli.

Author Murray was given unprecedented access to Lyric Opera of Chicago's Opera Center for American Artists during the 2003-2004 season. This is Lyric Opera's training ground for young artists. Murray follows this group of twelve singers through coaching sessions, rehearsals, auditions and performances to give the reader a close-hand look at the rigorous intensity of this most glorious art form. Interspersed with this are chapthers which fill out the picture of what it takes to succeed in opera. There is a chapter devoted to the comprimario - singers who specialize in secondary characters. Another chapter is devoted to Pavarotti, a warning of what can happen when one achieves what Murray dubs 'sacred monster' status. A sacred monster, superstar, Pavarotti was undone at the end of his career by his enormous ego. This book is a wonderful gift for those opera lovers on your Christmas list this season.	2005-10-14

It looks at the technologies, processes and the products from this tiny little land that are improving the lives of so many people. The authors highlight some of the people responsible for this ingenuity that is benefiting the whole world.<br /><br />For example, at the Weizmann Institute, Dr Michal Schwartz has developed a way of harnessing immune system cells to repair and revive damaged nerve fibres. Other medical breakthroughs include the miniscule camera-in-a-tablet used for internal diagnosis, ultrasound for destroying tumours and Israel's highly effective disaster relief operations.<br /><br />A great help to third world people has been the discovery by scientist Yoel Margalith of the Bti bacterium that kills certain kinds of flies and harmful mosquitoes.  This has already saved millions of livers and is an environment-friendly intervention. Most remarkable is that Margalith is a holocaust survivor, of both the Bergen-Belsen and Teresienstadt camps.<br /><br />In many fields Israel is so far ahead of the pack that other countries have no chance of catching up. One of the most interesting innovations developed in Israel is a project to avoid collisions between aircraft and migratory birds. It involved the study of the flight paths of birds. This work of researcher Yossi Leshem is now also used by the Jordanian and Turkish air-force.<br /><br />Israel has more engineers per capita than any other country on earth and a remarkable number of hi-tech companies. Innovation in the fields of computers and information technology is particularly impressive. This encompasses software, operating systems, storage & retrieval systems, verification and firewall technologies, plus a host of mobile phone applications.<br /><br />Israel's creativity is not restricted to science and technology, as there is also much happening in arts and culture. Despite its small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.<br /><br />The founders of this brave country were aware that Israel had almost no natural resources and that its people therefore had to develop and apply their brainpower. Well, they are succeeding spectacularly. What a pity that Israel has to devote so much of its money and resources to protect itself from its neighbours! If its full genius were given free reign, it would become even more of a blessing to the world.ts small size and its many enemies, this country is bursting with creative energy and making a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.

You would think that the opulent Mr. Sansweet would have in his possession every single poster to have ever rolled off the printing press for this unprecedented franchise but several of my favorite foreign one-sheets, daybills, banners and bus stop posters are notably missing.

Chances are he has every single one of them... locked away somewhere within the bowels of his coveted archives.  Most notably absent is the lack of reference material specifically promoting Revenge of the Sith and would seem to indicate that this book was completed and ready to be published just prior to the film's theatrical exhibition, but there is a plethora of wonderful international promotional material such as the six character U.K. bus stop posters that are much more visually exciting than the disappointing U.S. domestic ad campaign that demands to be published.

Champlin bravely asserts his own contribution to the great wealth of Neronian scholarship for the critics to pick apart. I find very little to quibble about.<br />It is difficult to write even-handedly about Nero for a Western audience. Who could forget the image of a man who \\"fiddled while Rome burned\\" or the terrible tyrant who had begun a nearly 170 year \\"persecution\\" of the early Christians, under whose reign both Peter and Paul were executed? As other reviewer comments reveal, you can easily earn the brand of a Nero \\"apologist\\" if you don't tow the party line, however inaccurate it might be.<br /><br />Champlin's thesis can be stated simply as follows: many, if not most of Nero's grandstands and outrageous actions, were performed out of considerable political shrewdness and calculation - not the madness or puerile excess wrongly attributed to a \\"live fast, die young, and leave a good looking corpse\\" emperor. Nero's success, Champlin argues in the first chapter, is evinced by a shockingly prolonged \\"afterlife\\" manifested in pseudo-Neros, Judeo-Christian apocalyptic writings, and a disenfranchised populace openly lamenting his death. Nonetheless, I cannot help but wonder, (working on the same assumption,) whether he had truly orchestrated his public relations as well as Champlin suggests given his untimely demise at age 30.<br /><br />Some reviewers disagree, but I reckon Champlin's original Nero-Periander link to be one of the most intriguing ideas in ancient biography I've ever seen. The ambivalent relationship with the mother, the Philhellenism, the artistic bent, and the numerous other links are too compelling to ignore outright, even if the conclusion a hard sell. Further research is warranted, but I suspect that Champlin, with his great intellect and energy, may have already exhausted all of the available evidence for advancing his thesis. He demonstrates the Augustus/Antony connections thoroughly. The discussion of the great fire of 64 is arrestingly well done: after convincingly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration. It hits you with dramatic effect almost equal to one of the primary sources comprising the centerpiece of his proof in this sudden reversal: Tacitus' Annales XV.67.<br /><br />Champlin's organization is somewhat bothersome as it is in \\"Final Judgments,\\" because he rejects chronological arrangement for thematic foci. This requires repetition of several facts, and I cannot understand his reasons for the chapter order. The post-mortem legacy of Nero, being most fascinating, he puts up front obviously to hook his reader. It serves as an interesting set piece for further discourse, because the inevitable wonder we feel about Nero's impression on the world ever after demands explanation: thus the rest of the book. But with Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitus unfolding the bulk of their own histories so methodically, the rearrangement isn't always a neat fit. Still, Champlin's brilliant weaving together of hundreds of sources, as before, vindicates his literary decisions several times over.<br /><br />Champlin, like any other historian, has his hypotheses and directs his evidence toward proving them. His presentation however, is replete with past scholarship and primary sources presented candidly and fairly. One of the most appreciable inclusions is the extensive collection of Latin graffiti, which add a critical dimension to our knowledge. This book has been for me an introduction into full-strength Neronian scholarship and I found it both accessible and empowering enough to read further with confidence.ngly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration.

There are however, some caveats for the reader. The book needs to be contextualized within a larger conceptual framework. The overarching issues are ignored within her practical framework, namely: Who needs to change? Who needs to accommodate whom?  How much? What are the risks and benefits? Her book appears to be saying that corporate America needs to understand Asians, but it does not need to change.  Rather it is the Asian professional that needs to change and adapt. <br /> <br />Is the book too heavily assimilationist?  It is not clear as Hyun does make a distinction early in her book between assimilation (\\"adopting ...at the expense of one's own cultural characteristics\\") and acculturation (\\"adapting ...while continuing to maintain values, perspectives, and features of one's native culture\\"). <br /> <br />There appears to be little adaptation of any Asian models or perspective to the mainstream USA corporate culture -- page 279 suggests two ways: \\"Develop cultural competency\\" and \\"Make use of your bicultural and bilingual abilities.\\" While recognizing the dominance of USA/Western research and models in the business world, it is also logical and no \\"one model fits all.\\" Perhaps future research and practices can provide indigenous Asian models or perspectives that can be adapted and work effectively in coporate America or other cultures.  The Special Issue on China & India (Business Week, August 22/29, 2005) points out how some USA business models are not applicable. <br /> <br />It is not an either/or proposition.  By utilizing the juxtaposition of the Asian behavior/values system versus the Western behavior/values system to present her central thesis, Hyun creates a false dichotomy in the mind of the reader. Current business literature is filled with exhortations of \\"win/win,\\" \\"both/and,\\" \\"alignment,\\" and \\"interdependence\\" -- all very Asian concepts. These traditional Asian cultural values are at the very heart of what contemporary corporate America is trying to effect in order to add value. So there is a \\"baby with the bath water\\" caveat here to the reader.  The accommodation needs to be reciprocal, not unilateral. <br /> <br />In her Epilogue, Hyun encourages the reader to \\"Develop an Action Plan That Works with Your Persona.\\"  It seems throughout her book that the emphasis is on asking the reader to tailor his or her persona to that which is required for success in corporate America, not on utilizing the behavioral strengths and cognitive positions with which someone who comes with a strong Asian cultural background is imbued.  Being Asian -- it seems to Hyun -- puts one in a deficit position. <br /> <br />The reader needs to be cautious in the self-assessment, individual profiles, exercises and tools cited. They yield helpful descriptive self-awareness profiles and information, not diagnostic or predictive profiles, and they are dependent on situational factors. There are many suggestions, based perhaps on many years of experience, but empirical data demonstrating their reliability, validity or efficacy are not mentioned. <br /> <br />Kudos to Hyun for encouraging the seeking of regular and frequent performance feedback. This is a career self-monitoring technique that is utilized far too little by all employees to help document and strengthen requests for job and salary advancement.  In spite of the conceptual conundrums, this highly practical book is a must read. <br /> <br />Adrian Chan (Kochman Mavrelis Associates, Oak Park, IL) & Barry Mar (Management & Resources Associates, Seattle, WA) <br />	2005-10-14

Both are in Illthwaite to get information relative to that which each is seeking. Both are staying in the local inn, called The Stranger House.<br /><br />Samantha is a brilliant but brash mathematician in her early twenties. Fondly known as Sam to her friends, she is interested in tracing her familial roots. She has recently discovered that her paternal grandmother was from this part of the world,  having been a part of a huge number of children migrants that had been unceremoniously shipped from England to other parts of its Empire, including Australia. Samantha is interested in finding out more about her paternal grandmother and the mystery surrounding her.<br /><br />Miguel, or Mig, as he is known to his family and friends, is the scion of a well-known house of vintners in Spain and is in his late twenties. He is a former seminarian who has suffered from manifestations of what he believes to be stigmata. He also, on occasion, sees ghostly manifestations or visions. Recovering from a serious alpine accident that nearly killed him, he is now in Illthwaite ostensibly to do research  for his thesis on the experience of English Catholics during the Reformation. He is, however, actually in Illthwaite to find out more about an ancestor of his who mysteriously disappeared there centuries ago during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.<br /><br />In Illthwaite, Both Sam and Mig find themselves up against obstacles placed in their way. It seems that its residents are not totally forthcoming or are reluctant to part with information relative to their respective quests. What they each individually discover is that things are not always as they seem in Illthwaite.  Moreover, their divergent interests are more intertwined than they could ever have imagined. They will discover that they have more in common than they realized, having come full circle in a cosmic design not of their making.<br /><br />This book has well-drawn characters that come alive under the author's expert hand. The plot is unusual, as well as complex, containing many layers that the discerning reader will enjoy exploring. Well-written, as well as intricately plotted, this book crosses a number of genres. With its supernatural portents, historical underpinnings, underlying mystery, as well as its gothic type  suspense and sensibilities, infused with just a dollop of  romance, this book will appeal to those readers who favor these genres. In particular, I found the parts of the book that transcended into historical fiction to be the most compelling. This is not a book for everyone, but to  those for whom its themes have inherent appeal, it is a book to be relished.mselves up against obstacles placed in their way.

The Aztec empire stretched between the Pacific and the Atlantic costs of Mesoamerica, the Maya kingdom was found in the eastern part of Mesoamerica, and the Inca Empire stretched 4,000 miles along the western coast of South America.  But this book considers the people of these regions to be a mosaic of tribes and nations so that most of the chapters are topical, talking about food and drink, religious life, masks, and such in terms of all of the cultures that apply.  There are a few specific chapters devoted to the Incas and their ancestors and Cities of the Andes, but most toss in everything together.<br /><br />I have to admit, I do not find this approach to work anymore than one about Mediterranean cultures that lumps Spain, Italy and Greece together with the likes of Portugal, Sicily, and Crete thrown in for good measure.  In this volume the Olmecs, Teotihuacans, and Toltecs are thrown in for good measure, but not so that you can have anything close to a clear conception of the specific cultures.  There are some topics where it makes sense to talk about multiple cultures, such as the Human sacrifice by the Incas and Aztecs, but that does not apply to all of these topics.  Consequently, I am tempted to get different colored highlighters and color code the three main cultures throughout the book so it is easier to make the connections.<br /><br />As always, the chief attraction of this Eyewitness Book is that it is filled with photographs of artifacts from museums around the world, from the Archaeological Museum in Lima the National Palace in Mexico City to the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Florence and the Rietberg Museum in Zurich (a subtle reminder that a lot of New World treasures made their way to Europe).  Most of us will never get to see a Toltec coyote warrior inlaid with mother-of-pearl, the Gateway of the Sun at Tiahuanaco, or a \\"teponaztli\\" (horizontal drum) in person.  \\"The Los Angeles Times Book Review\\" called one of these volumes \\"Like a mini-museum between the covers of a book,\\" which is so on point that DK always puts that quote on the back.  Almost as important, Elizabeth Bauedano provides detailed captions for the illustrations so that you know what you are looking at and what it means.  Consequently \\"Aztec, Inca & Maya\\" works better as a supplemental source than as an introduction to these fascinating civilizations.nlaid with mother-of-pearl, the Gateway of the Sun at Tiahuanaco, or a \\"teponaztli\\" (horizontal drum) in person.  \\"The Los Angeles Times Book Review\\" called one of these volumes \\"Like a mini-museum between the covers of a book,\\" which is so on point that DK always puts that quote on the back.

I have searched and searched for a great Arthurian retelling and have been disappointed with the ones I have ventured into reading. I was somewhat skeptical when I picked up Nancy McKenzie's Queen of Camelot. This two-novels-in-one compilation is based on Guenevere, from her point of view, in first person narrative, and is 623 pages long in very small print. I didn't want to waste my time reading something this big only to be disappointed at the end. I nevertheless gave the book a whirl. Glad I did! This is one of the most compelling and beautifully told retells I have ever read! McKenzie gives us a detailed story about Guenevere from her point of view. She tells us about the prophecy on the day she was born, how she spends her childhood as an adventurous tomboy, how people fear her and treat her differently as she grows up, how the knights around her battle with the Saxons, and how all of the prophecies come true. She meets Arthur, marries him and later has a love affair with Lancelot, something based on the original tale. But the novel has so much more than that. You will see how this story of magic, prophecies, love and betrayal transpires in an altered, detailed and beautiful light. There are many twists throughout the novel.<br /><br />Guenevere is developed in such an abundant, three-dimensional way in this novel. She is no longer just the pagan beauty who marries a Christian, betrays him and destroys all of Camelot as a result. She is a complex character with flaws as well as virtues in this offering. Arthur is also written in a more interesting, compelling way here, but it is Lancelot that once again blows me away. I have always romanticized Sir Lancelot and McKenzie does not disappoint me in her version of the loyal, chivalrous knight. Merlin and Morgan Le Fay are written with much complexity and nuance as well. This novel, however, does not focus so much on the love triangle between Guenevere, Arthur and Lancelot as much as her inability to supply an heir for Arthur and her affection for Arthur's bastard son, the traitorous Mordred. The overall story is magnificent. Once again, I say that McKenzie did a wonderful job bringing Guenevere to life. She turns this character into a strong, intelligent, complex, three-dimensional, flesh and blood woman, someone you will feel a great deal of affinity with. She is not portrayed as a simple-minded, traitorous hussy in this one! I loved the fanciful storytelling style that made me turn the pages until the wee hours of the night. Some of my friends who read the book along with me complained about it being too long-winded. I didn't think it was long-winded at all. In fact, I wish it had been longer.

It attempts to establish what Hitler knew and when he knew it. In effect, it is written from Hitler's point of view. The events are narrated in the order Hitler experienced them, and as he experienced them. Thus one gets a vivid feeling of being present as history unfolds, an experience stolen by \\"omiscient\\" historians and biographers. Of course Irving also includes a huge amount of information gleaned from sometimes exclusive interviews with witnesses and participants. This book has been controversial since it first appeared in the 1970s. It has been publicly criticized by many historians. But it has also been tacitly praised by them, insoar as they have borrowed heavily from Irving's research.	2005-10-14

In my mind, it is his greatest gift yet, but not in the sense that one might think. This will be explained in the closing. I will also preface by saying that I am in no way political. Truth is all that I am interested in. <br />   In Hawkins' previous 3 books, the kinesiological response was portrayed as infallible. His language was very absolute in its tone, giving the technique more credibility than it has ever received. Being so absolute with one's tone was the first obvious clue. When one becomes absolute in their tone, they often put an inordinate amount of faith in something outside themselves and overlook the inherent limitations. This is true for everything from religious absolutism to the mythical cure-all in medicine. The person who uses the absolute tone acts as if your salvation lies with this one particular thing.  <br />   I am a traditional naturopath. I was using kinesiology before Hawkins' books, and I am closely connected to practitioners of kinesiology who've used it in excess of 20 years. An observant and curious practitioner quickly realizes that the intent of both the testee and tester influences response. In some cases, a strong-willed practitioner who thinks he knows the cause of imbalance or dis-ease is affecting testee response and in essence using kinesiology to validate his own opinions and beliefs, albeit unknowingly. He will get the positive response he desires, whereas the practitioner with no vested interest in anything except the truth will get a different response on the same testee.  <br />   It has been difficult for me to bridge the gap between Hawkins' theory/ doctoral thesis on his use of kinesiology and the understanding that most experienced practitioners of kinesiology have. Nearly all experienced practitioners simply don't find the technique to be infallible. Certain criteria must be met for accurate response. Those criteria are training, impartiality, and the sincere and humble desire to put absolute truth above all things. Truth is absolute, but the technique is not. Remaining neutral is an ongoing challenge for the practitioner. <br /> <br />   I am not familiar with the testing methods used for Hawkins' doctoral thesis \\"Quantitative and Qualitative Calibration of the Levels of Consciousness\\". However, for it to withstand any scientific scrutiny, both the tester and testee would have to be without any knowledge on the subject matter. There would also have to be at least 20 different testers for the 3000+ test subjects, with each tester coming up with their own test responses to a given list of questions. Responses would not be compared until all testers have compiled their findings. For his thesis, something along these lines was most likely used.  <br />   Throughout \\"Power vs. Force\\", a healthy skepticism was maintained towards Hawkins putting so much faith in this technique. Part of this was based on an inability to get the same responses he was getting. The information presented in \\"The Eye of the I\\" and \\"I\\" was absolutely astounding, and skepticism was temporarily set aside. Apparently, his intent was pure and sincere enough to allow him to experience absolute truth on spiritual inquiry. Much of this can be attributed to his description of a life-changing experience. He was atheist (or possibly agnostic... don't remember which), hit a major crisis in his life, and finally called out in total humility to be shown the truth of God. I feel his pure intent allowed him to access the truth he did. <br />   However, once Hawkins gained confidence in the technique, he apparently fell into the trap of thinking he could divorce himself from influencing response. The methods used for gleaning the information found in \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\" would surely not withstand any scientific scrutiny. The simple fact that the subject matter was familiar to the tester(s) and testee(s) disqualifies it. Asking about the nature of life, death, and other unknown spiritual matters is not the same as asking about one's perceived reality, which one already has strong opinions and emotions about and attachments to. Both testers and testees would have to be completely unfamiliar with the line of inquiry to have any guarantee of neutrality. <br /> <br />   Within 30 seconds of opening \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\", it was clear something wasn't right. Hawkins' 3 previous books have helped us to discern truth from falsehood more clearly. Many of us have reached a place where now we `just know' the truth. It is often a clear gut feeling, and at that point the kinesiological response seems unnecessary. In a way, it turns out the technique was only a tool to guide us to our own inner knowing.  <br />   Hawkins acknowledges the existence of ignorance and untruth, but does not address the issue of deliberate deception. It is ironic that after years of devotion to the truth, Hawkins still does not fully grasp the nature of deception. The world citizenry is currently experiencing one of the most elaborate mass brainwashes in history.  <br />   In fact, Hawkins even engages in deception when he explains the Iraq situation. He indicates that the primary reason to be there is to protect the world's (and specifically America's) economic and oil interests. Yet the primary reason given to the public for going to war was weapons of mass destruction. Whether or not it was a fact that there were actually WMDs misses the point. It was given as the main reason, and it was not. That is deception. For Hawkins to agree with the idea of justifiable deceptions is a clear indicator that he is not neutral here. <br />   More importantly, for Hawkins to act as if outright deception is not occurring speaks to one's ability to deal with reality. For a person with 80 years of conditioned perception of reality to have reality turned on its head, a person could have a serious breakdown. <br /> <br />   The gift in this 4th book is that Hawkins has shown us what thekinesiological technique can and cannot be used for. It can be used by the sincere truthseeker for his/herself. However, it is not to be used to show one a reality they are not ready to see. There is no technique to make one see the truth. One's clear and sincere intention is all that can do that. And even then, one may not be ready to handle the fullness of reality. The process of how one \\"wakes up\\" is yet to be known. <br />   Who better than Hawkins to show us that experience is no substitute for impartiality? So, the readers of his 4th book get the opportunity to discern what is truth and what is his belief. The first 3 books prepared us, and the 4th is the test. Although he didn't intend it to work this way, it is the greatest gift of all. And just as importantly, it shows us that one can be quite enlightened in one area, while not having it all together in another. Even when one crosses the 600 line, one is still assailed by falsity and ignorance and must be constantly vigilant and unattached to one's beliefs.  <br /> <br />   And realistically, it couldn't have happened any other way. Given Hawkins' first 3 books and his audience, if he gave us the absolute truth about all the deceptions that make up the current perceived reality, it could have seriously messed some people up. It could result in serious mental breakdown if it was said that there aren't actually arab terrorists creating terror in America. So, the book had to be presented this way. And those of us who know the real truth know it through our own inner knowing already and don't need Hawkins to tell us. <br />   In `The Art of War', Sun Tzu said, \\"All warfare is based on deception.\\" Well, currently we have warfare in nearly every form. Even `necessary' and `justified' wars have deception as their roots. <br /> <br />Michael <br />Santa Fe, New Mexico	2005-10-14

Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.<br /><br />Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner	2005-10-14

My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.<br /><br />It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.<br /><br />The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days.	2005-10-14
US	53000124	R1KJ6MB7MRSQFF	0805076069	145341889	Bait and Switch: The (Futile) Pursuit of the American Dream	Books	4	9	11	N	N	I viewed this the opposite of Publisher's Weekly ...	This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surprised however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.	2005-10-14

Jim was snatched almost twenty years ago when he was seven and turned into the killing Seth whose goal was to murder Victoria for abandoning him.  However, her elation would turn to despair if she knew Seth resurfaced and started to rape a pregnant Tasha.<br /><br />Former military strategist Daniel Marks is in town complements of the Colby Agency that wants to hire him.  Also in Chicago is Emily Hastings whose father a veteran homicide detective was murdered.  She finds letters linking her dad to Victoria, the woman's long ago murdered first husband James, and her dad's first partner Marelyn Rutland that confuses her.  Soon she will meet Daniel and they will be embroiled in the COLBY CONSPIRACY that goes back almost two decades ago.<br /><br />Though the subplots can become confusing at first, once the audience comprehends how this complex superb suspense thriller starts to come together, they will want more Colby Agency tales; (see FILES FROM THE COLBY AGENCY: THE BODYGUARD'S BABY PROTECTIVE CUSTODY).  The ensemble cast is solid as fans will feel with Victoria who has overcome so much tragedy, hope Jim \\"defeats\\" Seth with Tasha at his side, and root for Daniel and Emily to make it while wondering what really happened two decades ago.  A final twist marks a strong Webb of deceit tale that showcases a fine author on her A-game.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner	2005-10-14

My only complaint is that this book was a bit repetative, and Holden's vocabulary only consists of 4 words: sonuvabitch, goddamn, lousy and phony. It was still quite humorous and the actual story was interesting.<br /><br />It was easy to read and to relate to, so you should pick it up if you're looking for a fun read. Some people complain about the lack of a plot, but to understand this book you need to read deeper into it. It's actually a lot more than some annoying kid's list of complaints about life.<br /><br />The story is about Holden Caulfield's coming of age and realizing that growing up is not a process that can be stopped. He had a lousy childhood, as he puts it, and wants to save other children from going though the things he experienced in his life. He is telling the story from a mental institution, which he was placed in after returning home from the fourth Prep school he had been kicked out of. He flashes back to the events leading up to his arrival at his home and tells the story of those 3 days.	2005-10-14

This book is chilling and depressing indeed, though very well written and sprinkled with frequent humor.  I was sort of surprised however by the comment in Publisher's Weekly which said that \\"PW suspects that many of those buyers will be disappointed. Ehrenreich can't deliver the promised story because she never managed to get employed in the 'midlevel corporate world' she wanted to analyze.\\"  I never viewed that as being the \\"promised story\\" in the first place.  To me, the primary point of the book was to describe what it was like to actually try to ENTER that world in the first place rather than describing what life was like when she got there--and that she did.  In fact, I actually thought that she \\"lucked out\\" in a sense by having the bizarre, surreal experiences she did--not only did it make for more entertaining and more thought-provoking reading, but in my mind, if she HAD obtained a job right away, it would have taken away the whole raison d'etre of the book.  It would have been a completely different book in which she merely described her (presumably) boring mid-level corporate job, which probably would have been the same from day to day.  Thus, at least for purposes of writing the book, I think she was \\"lucky\\" that things worked out the way they did.  As for the reader who criticized her for not taking the \\"jobs\\" offered by AFLAC and Mary Kay, I thought those comments were bizarre.  I agree with Ms. Ehrenreich's point in that \\"jobs\\" such as these in which the employer offers no salary, no benefits, no office, no help and essentially takes no risk whatsoever can hardly be considered jobs in the traditional sense she was seeking.  In any event, it's really a pretty scary and depressing book, but one which I recommend.	2005-10-14

WARNING!!,This book is solely making it from the false reviews/ advertisments from other books. Click on 'See all my reviews' from these following people, and you'll notice a common aspect: <br /> <br />serene thomas  <br />Ren \\"Ren\\"  <br />I'm sure there are more names, but they advertise the same message on nearly every other health/image book. <br /> <br /> <br />also, isn't it curious that many on the 5-starers have only written one review?? Look at the April 17-20, Jan 25-27 crowd... hmmm a little suspicious... especially since they occur in 2-3 day BLOCKS! <br /> <br />This book should be banned due to the author's wangling! <br /> <br />I'd advise you to read all the 1-star comments.

WARNING!!,This book is solely mak it from the false reviews/ advertisments from other books. Click on 'See all my reviews' from these follow people, and you'll notice a common aspect: <br /> <br />serene thomas  <br />Ren \\"Ren\\"  <br />I'm sure there are more names, but they advertise the same message on nearly every other health/image book. <br /> <br /> <br />also, isn't it curious that many on the 5-starers have only written one review?? Look at the April 17-20, Jan 25-27 crowd... hmmm a little suspicious... especially since they occur in 2-3 day BLOCKS! <br /> <br />This book should be banned due to the author's wangling! <br /> <br />I'd advise you to read all the 1-star comments.
It's About Time,The Georgia Straight's Lucas Aykroyd reviewed Van Halen 101 in this month's issue. Dur what was an overall positive review, he managed to write one line that perfectly summed up the book.    \\"This is a book about dudes, by a dude, written for other dudes.\\"    That one line says it all. Lucas got it. Just like the author got it. Mr. Sanchez may be just a \\"fan\\" to some, but this \\"fan\\" managed to do for Van Halen what no one else, be it fan or professional, has ever done for the band in their entire history. It's about time. Mr. Sanchez put together a fun, interesting, accurate book with a beautiful tribute to Eddie Van Halen. And since the band has never written their own story, and at this point likely never will, this will be as good as it gets.    Up until this point, the only written material we'd received from Van Halen \\"fans\\" never made the pass grade. I've been a VH fan since the band debuted and I own everyth ever written about them. Back in the nineties there was even some VH fanzine called \\"The Inside.\\" It was by some fan and his buddies. Other than the fact it had really nice pics, it was a typical fanzine written by what appeared to be some college guys with one too many VH posters on their wall. Not exactly a bastion of journalism or someth people will seek out years from now. At best, a minor blip on the radar screen.     Then there was the Van Halen Encyclopedia, a collaborative effort by hundreds of fans. It was a fine effort, but this too fell short. It's really just a journal of VH info listed alphabetically. Not the most excit read. More the cure for insomnia.    Van Halen 101 got it right and goes light years beyond anyth that has ever been written on the band. As Lucas said, \\"a book about dudes, by a dude, written for other dudes.\\" This ain't Motley Crue's \\"The Dirt.\\" And really, who would want to waste their money on a bunch of fiction dressed up nicely by Neil Strauss? Unlike \\"The Dirt,\\" Van Halen 101 is legit and positive andfocuses on what is truly important. No time to waste here with \\"inside scoops.\\" Fans who sit around drool and wait for that type of stuff need to get a life. Mr. Sanchez shows integrity by not rely on that type of material.     With Van Halen 101, what you see is what you get. No where on this book does the word \\"biography\\" appear. Ever. Not once. It has never been marketed or labeled as such. While it does contain plenty of biographical information on the band, the book is presented as a \\"comprehensive guide to the amaz history, music, impact and influence of the Mighty VH.\\" It says so, clear as day, on the back cover of Van Halen 101. So the author and publisher have never presented this as a \\"biography\\", nor have they ever claimed to have \\"inside scoops\\" or anyth of that sort. It's clearly stated the book is a comprehensive guide.    One of the best and easiest ways to determine a book's worth and status is to compare it to other books about the same subject. Just compare Van Halen 101 with the other VH book released in 2005, Backbeat Books \\"Eddie Van Halen: Know the Man, Play the Music.\\" Talk about night and day, Van Halen 101 demolishes that book. Absolutely crushed it. The funny th is that \\"Eddie Van Halen: Know the Man, Play the Music\\" was written by a \\"professional\\" writer named Malcolm Dome. Yes, Malcolm is a music journalist who also wrote another Van Halen book called \\"Excess in All Areas\\" back in the nineties. By the way, \\"Excess in All Areas\\" is awful, too.    Meanwhile, Van Halen 101 was written and entirely put together by a \\"fan.\\" Well, this \\"fan\\" knows more about VH than a thousand Malcolm Domes, that's for sure.     Van Halen 101 is well worth the money. There is simply noth out there in book form about Van Halen that comes anywhere close to it. Until the band members get off their duffs and put someth together, this is THE Van Halen book.
Goodbye, Girls,The Baby-Sitters Club books were the first that I remember reading. When I was a child, I would take books to the dinner table and read dur a meal (not the best manners, but my parents were ok with it because they encouraged me to read whenever I could). I was crazy about the BSC--I had the videos, dolls, even the sleep bag (which I received for my 11th birthday). I can say that I've read up to the point where the acquired Abby as a new sitter, but I spotted \\"Graduation Day\\" and had to read it. I feel that I \\"grew up\\" with these girls--even though they are still 13 and I am now 23. The end of a favorite series is bittersweet. Months ago, \\"passed the torch\\" to my 8 year old niece. On the first day of summer, I mailed her a copy of Kristy's Great Idea. She has fallen in love with the BSC and has now taken over the collection. When I went back home a few weeks ago, I had to smile when I saw a copy of \\"Claudia's Goodbye\\" in my old chair at the table.  <br />\\"Graduation Day\\" was terrific. The perfect end to a wonderful coming-of age series. Goodbye, Girls.
A Splendid Contribution,I have read a number of books on the Civil War in Washington...Fine as those books are, they do not accomplish two things that are splendid contributions of your book on the weekend home that the Lincolns made of their cottage at the Soldiers' Home. <br /> <br />First, we often forget the huge personal burden that the war place on Lincoln and his belief, strong in the summer of 1864, that he would be defeated in the next election and that the gains in the war would slip back into Southern control. We can see in your book how his days and nights in the cottage helped Lincoln to  hold on to and expand what he had until victory in the 1864 election was assured. <br /> <br />The other is the lov relationship of the President with his wife, Mary Lincoln. We often hear of her oddities and runn up of debts. What we do not hear of, and what admirably is stressed in your book, is what you describe as \\"the mutual affection and mutual dependence\\" that always linked them despite their great differences in character.  Respect for Mary Lincoln, and her contributions to the greatness of Abraham Lincoln, is someth we could use more of in writ American history. <br /> <br />I will not go on expect to say that I think I have already indicated the greatness of your book, and my hope that librarians and readers everywhere will have an opportunity to benefit from its revelations and the new light it brings on the life of one of our very greatest Presidents. <br />
Good Sears primer,If you are new to Dr Sears and sleep is your only issue this would be a nice choice. I found lots of the sleep ideas in The Baby Book which also has everyth else you need about rais your baby. The Baby Book would be my first choice from Sears.
Don't waste your time,I have read several books on ADD and found this book to be full of the same old falacies and myths about Nutrition, medication and biofeedback as all the rest, and none of it works! It was a waste of my time and money. Don't bother! <br /> <br />The most helpful book that I have read is The ADD & ADHD answer Book by Dr. Susan AShley Ph.D. <br />
got what i paid for, not sure if it works yet.,I got what I paid for but I'm not sure if it works yet.  This is one CD and at the beginn of the CD on track 1 it says you should not listen to this CD unless you have about 1/2 hour of alone time.  It leads you to beleive you need to listen to a Disc 2 if you want to drive and listen at the same time.  There is no Disc 2, instead you need to listen to track 6 while driv or anyth like that.  That should be stated on the review, which it's not.  At first I thought I had to buy another CD in order to effectively use this.
Best I have read,I believe it would be fair to say that what a person gets out of a book on trad has a lot to do with their ability to understand and relate to what they read and the degree that the new information gels with what they already consider to be true.  Hav said that, I am glad that I did not allow so-so reviews of this book to stop me from purchas it.  My interest is in day trad e-mini futures.  Other books I have read relat to Elliott wave have only provided minimal general guidance.  This is the only book on Elliott wave that I have found invaluable.  It took a few readings and some practice but, low and behold, I can now (often) scrutinize a wave and determine if it is an impulse wave or a correction.  The beauty of this is that it allows you to know if you are still in a correction or if the trend has resumed.  It allows you to know if there has been a 5th wave failure or if some form of correction is still developing.  At the end of a 5th wave when the market is spik up and down I can eventually tell if a new thrust in the direction of the trend is part of the trend and possibly the end of the 5th wave or whether it is just a part of a diagonal triangle.  I have a long way to go in master it but I can often see the C wave patterns and appreciate what is go on.  All in all, the market makes more sense to me now.  One reviewer commented that do this would not be possible on intraday charts.  I would have to disagree.  Even small C waves can take 30 minutes to hours to develop.  Once the market has made enough of a move to recognize the correction you would only need a couple of minutes to figure it out even if you consulted the book.  So, in short, I am impressed and consider this the best book on trad I have ever read.
Good for only a few people,Most reviewers either gush or bash. Bash was our first instinct, but that wouldn't be fair or useful. Let me explain... Total Body Makeover is another widely promoted health and fitness book my wife and I had on our list to read this summer (see all my reviews). The process we go through is to read it, try out a few of its ideas for a while, then read it again. On the first pass we both recoiled. The primary vehicle the author uses to communicate with his readers is to make emotional connections, not by provid actual information. (Much like the BFL for Women book). It relies heavily on third party client stories to get the page count up to sellable form. By the time you get to \\"Renee's Story\\" towards the end, you may either be asleep or tear the pages out -- and that would be a shame, as the last 23 pages are quite useful. At the end of the book are 10 concise and informative comparative reviews of the most popular diet programs. You might be able to find the same info on the Internet for free but we've not come across one before so comprehensive and unbiased. Could be very helpful for someone weigh diet alternatives (honest... that was not an intended pun, it just slipped out :) <br /> <br />Not all readers are the same of course and some people may respond well to the book's Oprah-fluff. If you strip it out you're left with a rather serious proposition: Is your health and fitness situation dire enough, are you upset enough, are you serious about it enough, are you committed enough to spend 2 hours every day work out, plus spend the extra time it takes to plan, modify, and follow through on a new diet routine?  <br /> <br />The program esposed is a wolf in sheep's cloth and the book's title is apt. It really is \\"total body makeover\\" at its core. From our several week trials, very few people are go to be able to follow through with the program on their own for logistical and time management reasons. Those few that do will benefit. Prevent back-slid after the 12 week \\"boot camp\\" is also a very real challenge. The author addresses this topic, but in our experience all the get-fit-quick programs suffer high rates of back-sliding. That this program's pedegree is celebrity-trainer based is obvious to us.  <br /> <br />So where does the book end up in our stack? It's more useful than BFL for Women. Not as helpful to the masses as the original BFL. The only book that stands out from the crowd so far is Avery Hunicutt's Joe X. (We practice the Joe X routine now and so impressed with the book we're go to go back and re-review it at some point. We didn't give it near enough credit the first time around. But next up: we'll be review Harley Pasternak's 5-Factor Fitness, another of the heavily promoted books.)
An Unexpected Gift to Hawkins' Readers,\\"Truth vs Falsehood\\" is Hawkins' 4th book. In my mind, it is his greatest gift yet, but not in the sense that one might think. This will be explained in the closing. I will also preface by say that I am in no way political. Truth is all that I am interested in. <br />   In Hawkins' previous 3 books, the kinesiological response was portrayed as infallible. His language was very absolute in its tone, giv the technique more credibility than it has ever received. Be so absolute with one's tone was the first obvious clue. When one becomes absolute in their tone, they often put an inordinate amount of faith in someth outside themselves and overlook the inherent limitations. This is true for everyth from religious absolutism to the mythical cure-all in medicine. The person who uses the absolute tone acts as if your salvation lies with this one particular thing.  <br />   I am a traditional naturopath. I was us kinesiology before Hawkins' books, and I am closely connected to practitioners of kinesiology who've used it in excess of 20 years. An observant and curious practitioner quickly realizes that the intent of both the testee and tester influences response. In some cases, a strong-willed practitioner who thinks he knows the cause of imbalance or dis-ease is affect testee response and in essence us kinesiology to validate his own opinions and beliefs, albeit unknowingly. He will get the positive response he desires, whereas the practitioner with no vested interest in anyth except the truth will get a different response on the same testee.  <br />   It has been difficult for me to bridge the gap between Hawkins' theory/ doctoral thesis on his use of kinesiology and the understand that most experienced practitioners of kinesiology have. Nearly all experienced practitioners simply don't find the technique to be infallible. Certain criteria must be met for accurate response. Those criteria are training, impartiality, and the sincere and humble desire to put absolute truth above all things. Truth is absolute, but the technique is not. Remain neutral is an ongo challenge for the practitioner. <br /> <br />   I am not familiar with the test methods used for Hawkins' doctoral thesis \\"Quantitative and Qualitative Calibration of the Levels of Consciousness\\". However, for it to withstand any scientific scrutiny, both the tester and testee would have to be without any knowledge on the subject matter. There would also have to be at least 20 different testers for the 3000+ test subjects, with each tester com up with their own test responses to a given list of questions. Responses would not be compared until all testers have compiled their findings. For his thesis, someth along these lines was most likely used.  <br />   Throughout \\"Power vs. Force\\", a healthy skepticism was maintained towards Hawkins putt so much faith in this technique. Part of this was based on an inability to get the same responses he was getting. The information presented in \\"The Eye of the I\\" and \\"I\\" was absolutely astounding, and skepticism was temporarily set aside. Apparently, his intent was pure and sincere enough to allow him to experience absolute truth on spiritual inquiry. Much of this can be attributed to his description of a life-chang experience. He was atheist (or possibly agnostic... don't remember which), hit a major crisis in his life, and finally called out in total humility to be shown the truth of God. I feel his pure intent allowed him to access the truth he did. <br />   However, once Hawkins gained confidence in the technique, he apparently fell into the trap of think he could divorce himself from influenc response. The methods used for glean the information found in \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\" would surely not withstand any scientific scrutiny. The simple fact that the subject matter was familiar to the tester(s) and testee(s) disqualifies it. Ask about the nature of life, death, and other unknown spiritual matters is not the same as ask about one's perceived reality, which one already has strong opinions and emotions about and attachments to. Both testers and testees would have to be completely unfamiliar with the line of inquiry to have any guarantee of neutrality. <br /> <br />   Within 30 seconds of open \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\", it was clear someth wasn't right. Hawkins' 3 previous books have helped us to discern truth from falsehood more clearly. Many of us have reached a place where now we `just know' the truth. It is often a clear gut feeling, and at that point the kinesiological response seems unnecessary. In a way, it turns out the technique was only a tool to guide us to our own inner knowing.  <br />   Hawkins acknowledges the existence of ignorance and untruth, but does not address the issue of deliberate deception. It is ironic that after years of devotion to the truth, Hawkins still does not fully grasp the nature of deception. The world citizenry is currently experienc one of the most elaborate mass brainwashes in history.  <br />   In fact, Hawkins even engages in deception when he explains the Iraq situation. He indicates that the primary reason to be there is to protect the world's (and specifically America's) economic and oil interests. Yet the primary reason given to the public for go to war was weapons of mass destruction. Whether or not it was a fact that there were actually WMDs misses the point. It was given as the main reason, and it was not. That is deception. For Hawkins to agree with the idea of justifiable deceptions is a clear indicator that he is not neutral here. <br />   More importantly, for Hawkins to act as if outright deception is not occurr speaks to one's ability to deal with reality. For a person with 80 years of conditioned perception of reality to have reality turned on its head, a person could have a serious breakdown. <br /> <br />   The gift in this 4th book is that Hawkins has shown us what thekinesiological technique can and cannot be used for. It can be used by the sincere truthseeker for his/herself. However, it is not to be used to show one a reality they are not ready to see. There is no technique to make one see the truth. One's clear and sincere intention is all that can do that. And even then, one may not be ready to handle the fullness of reality. The process of how one \\"wakes up\\" is yet to be known. <br />   Who better than Hawkins to show us that experience is no substitute for impartiality? So, the readers of his 4th book get the opportunity to discern what is truth and what is his belief. The first 3 books prepared us, and the 4th is the test. Although he didn't intend it to work this way, it is the greatest gift of all. And just as importantly, it shows us that one can be quite enlightened in one area, while not hav it all together in another. Even when one crosses the 600 line, one is still assailed by falsity and ignorance and must be constantly vigilant and unattached to one's beliefs.  <br /> <br />   And realistically, it couldn't have happened any other way. Given Hawkins' first 3 books and his audience, if he gave us the absolute truth about all the deceptions that make up the current perceived reality, it could have seriously messed some people up. It could result in serious mental breakdown if it was said that there aren't actually arab terrorists creat terror in America. So, the book had to be presented this way. And those of us who know the real truth know it through our own inner know already and don't need Hawkins to tell us. <br />   In `The Art of War', Sun Tzu said, \\"All warfare is based on deception.\\" Well, currently we have warfare in nearly every form. Even `necessary' and `justified' wars have deception as their roots. <br /> <br />Michael <br />Santa Fe, New Mexico
A Creative Case of Hiccups!,What happens when a purple rotund hippontimus has hiccups so fearce they blast everyth and everyone around him into flight? Humor, that's what.<br /><br />Author and illustrator Aaron Zenz presents a whimsical rhyme of epic proportions in his first children's picture book \\"The Hiccupontamus.\\" Beautifully illustrated, and in a Dr. Suess-like manner, the story creates many words that would send Daniel Webster reeling.<br /><br />\\"There was a hippopotamus<br /><br />Who hiccupped quite-a-lotamus<br /><br />And every time he got'emus<br /><br />He'd fall upon his bottomus.\\"<br /><br />Zenz rendered all of the humorous cartoon illustrations us colored pencils, us 119 in all. The Spr Lake, Michigan resident holds an art degree from Hillsdale College. \\"The Hiccupotamus\\" took eight years to complete and is published by Chicago-based Dogs In Hats Children's Publishing.<br /><br />The print quality of the book is ultra-professional and brings out Zenz' pressure-applied pencils to vibrant life. It is often a competitive page quandary for the reader which to love most; the story or the drawings. The chemistry between text and pictures is remarkable, and rivals the best children's books ever published.<br /><br />Aaron Zenz enjoys communicat with kids of all ages through art lessons to home schooled children and Sunday School classes. His outreach to children can only grow with this jewel of a book.
Let the children play,This book will rescue children from boredom and angst, if parents will read it.  It urges families to lighten up -- to stop excessive worry about traffic, poison ivy, kidnappers, snakes, and broken arms and let children go outside and have fun. It's easy. If you don't live near woods, any small patch of nature will do: This writer sings the praises of vacant lots, where beetles live under rocks and dandelion tufts wait  to be blown into the wind. Take your child outside and make a necklace of clover flower.  If there's a creek nearby, let him put his foot in. Find blackberries and pick them. If you have woods, encourage a fort.    Oh, brave, new mom am I. A few days this summer, I let my two boys, ages 7 and 9, ride their bikes with neighbor children to a nearby creek. They waded and played and had a picnic. The boogie man didn't get them; a snake didn't get them (though they did see a snake).  We called these days \\"wander days,\\" quot a children's book we like. They'll remember these wander days much longer than any trip to the local science museum.    Thanks, Louv. This book is an act of love for youngsters.
An Excellent Introduction to Ramtha and his Teachings,The book comprises of: <br />A forward by the channel, JZ Knight (the only human be that Ramtha has channelled through). <br />An introductory essay describ Ramtha's teachings <br />Part 1.  The Autobiography of Ramtha's life <br />Part 2.  The Fundamental concepts of the teachings. <br /> <br /> <br />The Introductory Essay describes the background to Ramtha's teachings and highlights their uniqueness.  Not only do they address the fundamental questions of our origins and nature, but they deliver a comprehensive legacy of knowledge based on pure reason and science.  Coupled with this, are disciplines which give the student a means to experience and verify the philosophical aspects of the teachings, thus consolidat the knowledge as their own wisdom and personal truth. <br />Ramtha's School of Enlightenment (RSE) is likened to the ancient mystery schools of Egypt, Greece and Persia.  As a school, it provides the fertile ground in which the student can expand and liberate their mind from their old indoctrinations and find their freedom through the exploration of their spiritual nature. <br /> <br /> <br />Part 1 <br />Ramtha the Enlightened One talks of his life 35,000 years ago and what led him to become a great warrior and conqueror.  He describes his recovery after be run through by a sword which led to his own self mastery and final ascension in front of his 2 million strong army. <br /> <br /> <br />Part 2 <br />Ramtha discusses our origins from the Void, the creation of time and the eventual evolution of the human form.  He describes the nature of God - the Observer and how reality is formed.  In addition, he explains how the brain works, the electromagnetic field around the body and how we can change.  He also addresses the concept of hope and the problems we experience with doubt and how every thought we have is constantly shap our reality <br /> <br /> <br />This is a fabulous book for anyone seek answers to these fundamental questions.  Itis especially complementary with many of the popular quantum physics books such as The Self Aware Universe by Amit Gotswami, The Field by Lynne McTaggart or Parallel Universes by Fred Alan Wolf. <br /> <br /> <br />
An excellent reference, not for beginners,Step by step instruction is lack and certain fundamental ideas are assumed to be known and understood by the reader...  a complete beginner would be lost with this book alone.  It is an invaluable reference for someone who has a certain level of practical experience, but a book like Don Kraig's Modern Magick would be preferable to start with. <br /> <br />That be said, it is a virtual \\"must have\\" in the library of any serious magician, be they traditional GD, thelemite, aurum solis, or of any other western tradition.
WHY NOT PRACTICE FREE ENTERPRISE?,This book isn't merely a primer for capitalist thinking, it is a Bible for free enterprise.  Everyone on the planet should read MILLIONAIRE REPUBLICAN, then utilize the implements provided.  The result would be a peaceful, hard-work universe. <br /> <br />I look forward to the day Mr. Root becomes a novelist and weaves his philosophy through the prism of fiction.  MOVE OVER, AYN RAND.
Amazing.,<br />This is a brilliant, brilliant book. It's very stylish and it explains everyth in a clear,  thoughtful intelligent way. Best of all it has lots of suggestions for games and tricks to do with your partner ( the one with the fruit was my favourite) . I love this book (and now, so does my husband). Get it and your life will change. <br /> Mine did!
An engag study,Kim's work has won the praise of many, not least Robert Aitken Roshi, an American with a lifetime's experience of Zen training. In his foreword to the third edition, Aitken Roshi stated:   <br /> <br /> \\"this revised edition . . .now includes many new translations and studies of Dogen, and thus it is most welcome. Dogen wrote at the outermost edge of human communication, touch with every sentence such mysteries as self and other, self and non-self, meditation and realization, the temporal and the timeless, forms and the void.@He wrote of the attitude necessary for understanding, of the practice required. . .of the various insights that emerge, and of the many pitfalls. He did not generally write for beginners - most of his points require very careful study and a few of them elude almost everybody. These challenges are compounded by his creative use of the Japanese language. It has been said that he wrote in \\"Dogenese,\\" for he made verbs of nouns, nouns of verbs, created new metaphors, and manipulated old sayings to present his particular understanding. . . \\"  <br /> <br /> Prof. Kim's study has been based on a careful read of Dogen's chosen idioms. He has endeavoured to amplify Dogen's understand of 'do-ri' - or 'reason of the way.' Kim is keen to show that Dogen's use of Zen language is not merely provisional or instrumental, but embodies a 'realisational' dimension. This is exemplified in the notion of the 'genjo-koan' or koan realised in the present, which is to say, actualised in every day activity. In this way, Kim endeavours to show that Dogen's Zen culminates in ' the great way of total exertion' (gujin no daido) or the total actualisation of practice as realization. Kim is a foremost interpreter of Dogen's thought - and, as such, this book deserves a place in every Buddhist library. My only reservation about this study, is that it might have made better sense of the question of how the so-called 'instrumentalist' aspect of koan practice relates tothe 'realizational' aspect. Quite rightly, Kim is at pains to point out that accounts of Zen which stress the 'instrumentalist' view of koan practice - and that alone, are one sided, and he has therefore endeavoured to illustrate a different perspective. However, without reflection, we might be left to conclude that Rinzai Zen favours the 'instrumentalist' view - and Soto, the 'realizational' view. Kim knows better, and indeed, in places (p. 165), he has cited certain remarks from Dogen, which concede that the term 'genjo-koan' originated with Engo - a Rinzai master of the Sung, evidently mean that Rinzai practitioners have appreciated the 'realizational' aspect. As such, the critical references to (Dai-e) Ta-hui which appear elsewhere in the book, seem strangely out of tenor with this fact. Yuan-wu (Engo) was Ta-hui's teacher, and the latter must surely have known of his master's references to the genjo-koan. Conversely, much as we might identify Dogen's Zen with 'shikantaza' (just-sitting), play down the instrumentalist approach, Dogen also had his experience of 'cast off mind and body' (shinjindatsuraku) - a breakthrough experience more or less akin to that realised by Rinzai followers. Perhaps Prof. Kim will enlighten us on this unresolved problem, at some future point.
Important wisdom from the Ancients,I am surprised to see so few reviews here, as this book has had such an influence on my life. I do not know how to begin to adequately express its significance, and perhaps that is appropriate. Those who are ready for the knowledge will be drawn to it in a time and manner which is right for them.  <br /> <br />\\"When the ears of the student are ready to hear, then cometh the lips to fill them with Wisdom.\\" -- The Kybalion <br /> <br />Ancient Future is a \\"modern\\" approach to the ancient wisdom of Kemet, which was passed from lips to ear since pre-diluvian days and then more recently (about a hundred years ago), was recorded in a book entitled \\"Kybalion\\". Kybalion has been out of print for a long time, but can be found if you diligently seek it.
Neal Stephenson lite,In recent years, Stephenson's work has become increasingly complicated.  The Baroque cycle is a study in intricate plots, characters that seem to number in the thousands, and difficult material that is not readily accessible to the average novel reader.  The Cryptonomicon met that description as well, but to a lesser degree.  While I enjoyed those books precisely for their complexity, many readers probably found them to be frustrat to read and difficult to follow. <br />  <br />The Stephen Bury novels do not present this problem for the casual reader.  They are stripped of most of the technical lingo, and they tend to follow more in the footsteps of modern thrillers.  The difference between these novels and the average Tom Clancy clone is that they revolve around powerful critiques of modern political cultures and bureacracies. <br /> <br />The Cobweb is the better of these two novels.  The central critique of the intelligence community is that competence without political acumen is tantamount to career suicide.  The book tracks the months between Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and the start of Gulf War I and poses a terrify question: what if the greatest enemies to our national security are the egomaniacs at the top of the security apparatus?  Given the events that have transpired in between the writ of this novel and today, the question raised by this novel seems prescient. <br /> <br />The one th that is lack from the Stephen Bury novels is the decadence of Stephenson's other works.  Stephenson is a novelist who has spent pages discuss the Captain Crunch-eat ritual of one of his characters (Cryptonomicon), the mak of watered steel blades (the Baroque Cycle), and other incidental but vastly entertain subjects too numerous to mention.  These passages exquisitely sideline the plots of his books for an exercise in pure intellectual indulgence.  Sadly, you will not find any such passages in this novel or in Interface.
A book to raise consciousness and br peace to our world.,This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to grow spiritually, who wants to live a conscious and compassionate life, and who wants to contribute to world peace. I have read many books on the topic of vegetarianism, animal rights and animal welfare,  spiritual growth, and peace and nonviolence. This book stands alone in its ability to make the connection between all of these subjects. <br /> <br />Will Tuttle, Ph.D. is a rare combination of extraordinary compassion, scholarly research and education, spiritual commitment and wisdom, intuitive insights, and the courage to challenge a worldview which goes back 10,000 years <br />  <br />In this book, Tuttle explores humanity's relationship with the foods we eat.  He points out, very convincingly, that when humans began herd animals, it began to create a consciousness of exploitation which then spread to the control and domination of other humans, as well as animals.  So the roots of human's violence to humans are found in the practice of see animals as objects to exploit for our own purposes: for food, furs, labor, entertainment, \\"sport\\" and experimentation. The use of humans as slaves and the subjugation of women followed the subjugation and enslavement of animals. <br /> <br />One th that sets this book apart from any of the others that describe the problems associated with a meat-based diet is the focus on the spiritual aspects of our diet.  When we take food into our bodies, we are also ingest the energy contained in this food. Animals that are tortured and filled with terror and agony as they are killed are filled with this very negative energy.  When humans eat their flesh, we are also ingest this fear and anger. This affects us deeply.  We cannot live with peace in our hearts as long as we are fill our bodies with the pain and suffer of other beings. <br />   <br />Tuttle helps us to see that none of us have actually chosen a diet based upon meat. Our mothers fed us meat from our infancy.As we got old enough to understand that we were eat animals, we were told that animals were put here for us to eat, so it was okay.  We didn't question this, any more than we questioned wear clothes or tak baths. Thus, we absorbed the acceptance of exploitation of animals so naturally that we didn't know it was happening.  And be unconscious, it is hard to recognize the violence that is part of our everyday lives through the eat of animals.  Therefore, it is also hard to recognize how insensitive we have become to violence, because we have to protect ourselves from an awareness of the violence we are part of 3 times a day.   <br />  <br />This is a very important book for everyone who wants their lives to contribute to more peace in the world, rather than more suffer and violence.  <br />  <br />
Church in crisis? Donald to the rescue!,Thank goodness! Over 2,000 + years of bor old tradition, square churches, and legalism can now be corrected by Donald Miller.  This guy moves from Texas to Oregon and realizes he needs a bigger suitcase to move Christianity with him: Extreme faith makeover, Christianity addition. I discerned two points from this book: (1) smok and drink are not sins and (2) Christians don't all think like fundamentalists. These revelations hardly require you to invest your time and money in blue like jazz. Take Calvin, take Hayek, take hope.
Most Inspir Book Of 2005: An Unreasonable Woman,Reasonably speaking, \\"Unreasonable Woman\\" is the most inspir and inspired book I've read all year.    In this true life story, which represents yet another publish coup by Vermont independent Chelsea Green Press ([...]), Diane Wilson - work class shrimp boat captain and mother of five - recounts the often-harrow account of her five year fight to hold corporate polluter Formosa Plastics to a \\"zero emissions\\" policy for their insidious (but all too typical) waste disposal methods in Wilson's town of Sea Drift, Texas.    And get this.    Wilson won.    How she defeated the machinations of one of the world' largest and most powerful industrial polluters is the subject of the book, which also offers honest insights into life in a southern seaside work class community from a woman's point of view, a community that I never knew existed (though the EPA ranks it as one of the most polluted counties in the country).     And who out there knows women can captain shrimp boats? Or understands that women actually can play characters other than vamps or victims? I've read books populated with women all my life, but until this real life story, I've never met a woman like Diane Wilson. In a literary world dripp with testosterone, car chases, and gun play, Wilson is no shrink violet, no damsel in distress.     Exactly the opposite. She intuits her way through what becomes one of the most courageous struggles for justice  I've read in a long while, challeng corporate control over our economic and political life with grit, good humor, and vernacular insights that, while uneven in some places, made me laugh and cry and cheer and buy copies of this book for friends and family.    She also, in the most wry and self-deprecat way imaginable, made most of the men in her life look like pantywaists by comparison.     Books like an \\"Unreasonable Woman\\" come along only rarely. Diane Wilson is a work class heroine with heart, an activist with the guts to do somethingabout the problems confront her. The world is a better place for hav her and her story in it.     If you are not inspired after read this book, it might be time to forgo read altogether.
Solid Book About Fac Death and Kill in War,Whether intentional or not, this book's audience is the former or current military member.  But if you have read and enjoyed works such as the first two volumes of \\"Roots of Strategy\\", you should have no trouble follow this book.    The author successfully shows that military personnel have mixed feelings about war.  Although he addresses behavior in the midst of battle, the author seems more interested in the views about war held by those outside war itself, i.e., those who had not yet experienced it and those who were look backward in retrospect.  How those people felt in the midst of the madness is almost certainly different from how they anticipated or how they adjusted their feelings afterwards.  I think this \\"flavor\\" derives from his personal-interview-and-historical-research approach.  I do not see this as a negative but rather stay within his scope of knowledge and expertise.    The review titled \\"Flawed work of a historian with no sociological credibility\\" seems too harshly critical.  Perhaps this reviewer expected a highly technical, in-depth psychological approach.  As a note: page 58 cites S.L.A. Marshall as stat that only \\"some 15 per cent of American infantrymen fired.\\"  True, the subject of women in the military is barely broached.  However, in all fairness, the author never pretends to have extensive knowledge about how women react in battle and simply doesn't go there.  Perhaps that is a deficiency of character, but not of the book.  I get the feel that this review didn't find what he wanted and then \\"skimmed\\" the book without think into what was be presented.      Although now much more interested in peace studies, I enjoyed read this book.  I found a number of passages that shed light on where I have been and where I seek to go.  I don't see this as a pro-military book although at times it may seem so.  I characterize it as an honest endeavor to address and understand some of the difficult questions that most of us have concern death and kill in war-time.
The PERFECT resource for ghost hunters!,<br />Finally! <br />I love this book -- I've been ghost hunt for years now and I can't believe it took this long to see a directory come out that's written by the actual ghost hunters. I only wish there were more locations in my state, but I guess if the book covered every haunted location there is with this level of detail the book would be about a million pages. I also love some of the ghost photos with some of the entries!
John Quincy Adams,John Quincy Adams, son of John Adams, the second President, was one of America's greatest diplomats. He made a name for himself as the country was be formed, especially with his defense of \\"the rules of law\\" against the will of the majority. He was one of the last of the old Federalists. He was a foreign minister to Holland, Portugal, and Prussia, and was Secretary of State under Monroe (where he was the main force in establish the Monroe Doctrine). He became the sixth President in a controversial election that was decided in the House of Representatives.<br /><br />Parson's short (272 pages) but thorough and well-written biography of Adams is a job well done. She details the accomplishments of his life, but focuses primarily on the man himself. Adams was a stern man (his portrait reminds me of some evil Dickens character, Marley perhaps), and not well-liked by the public. He believed that one should not \\"run\\" for a political office, but should just accept it if offered (imagine that today!). He hated Andrew Jackson and slavery, and fought hard against both. This is an excellent book on an interest man.
A Helpful Primer on Mystical Thought,There's a lot of useful information in this book, and it may be the only place to get all of that knowledge in a single volume.  You'll need some read stamina, because it's long and parts of it are uninteresting.  Hall's facts are wrong in a couple of places (just a few examples: his chapter on Islam is pretty much worthless, and since when was Thor's hammer made of ram's horns?) and he seems to have an axe to grind, in terms of link Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism to Pythagoreanism, Alchemy, etc etc to the shadowy Illuminati pull the strings behind the formation of the United States and its model of government.  America supposedly has some sort of Mystical Destiny that was predetermined by a group of Immortal Magi, the true initiates of the Elysian and Hermetic mysteries, and so on.  Please .. tone down the crazy just a bit, Mr. Hall! <br />You'll have to read with a slightly critical eye to pick out which parts of this book are useful to you and which parts are not, but overall it is definitely worth the effort.  I was introduced to a lot of new ideas.  One of the benefits of mysticism is the new perspective it can give you, a new way of perceiv the same old things you've been look at all your life.  There are profound secrets everywhere which will reveal themselves to the one who makes the EFFORT to discover them. <br />As far as this book be \\"evil,\\" it just plain isn't.  It may pose a challenge to the dogmatic status-quo of the current dominant religion (which incidentally, is fail to meet the needs of modern civilization) ... but that religion itself was regarded as a threaten evil 2000 years ago when it encroached on the very Mysteries which Hall elucidates in this book.  The only \\"evil\\" be perpetrated is by those who would - for their own selfish reasons - keep humanity in spiritual darkness.  So there.
God is not the instigator of trouble in our life, but he does make good on his promise to see us through these trails,I don't normally do book reviews--probably because I'm not very good at them, but the book I just finished touched me in such a way that I want to share it with all of my fellow writers and book enthusiasts.<br /><br />Title: Why the Sky is Blue<br /><br />Author: Susan Meissner<br /><br />Genre:  Christian fiction--primary reader group:  women<br /><br />Claire Holland is raped on her way home from the mall.

The man, the monster, the legend.,Champlin bravely asserts his own contribution to the great wealth of Neronian scholarship for the critics to pick apart. I find very little to quibble about.<br />It is difficult to write even-handedly about Nero for a Western audience. Who could forget the image of a man who \\"fiddled while Rome burned\\" or the terrible tyrant who had begun a nearly 170 year \\"persecution\\" of the early Christians, under whose reign both Peter and Paul were executed? As other reviewer comments reveal, you can easily earn the brand of a Nero \\"apologist\\" if you don't tow the party line, however inaccurate it might be.<br /><br />Champlin's thesis can be stated simply as follows: many, if not most of Nero's grandstands and outrageous actions, were performed out of considerable political shrewdness and calculation - not the madness or puerile excess wrongly attributed to a \\"live fast, die young, and leave a good look corpse\\" emperor. Nero's success, Champlin argues in the first chapter, is evinced by a shockingly prolonged \\"afterlife\\" manifested in pseudo-Neros, Judeo-Christian apocalyptic writings, and a disenfranchised populace openly lament his death. Nonetheless, I cannot help but wonder, (work on the same assumption,) whether he had truly orchestrated his public relations as well as Champlin suggests given his untimely demise at age 30.<br /><br />Some reviewers disagree, but I reckon Champlin's original Nero-Periander link to be one of the most intrigu ideas in ancient biography I've ever seen. The ambivalent relationship with the mother, the Philhellenism, the artistic bent, and the numerous other links are too compell to ignore outright, even if the conclusion a hard sell. Further research is warranted, but I suspect that Champlin, with his great intellect and energy, may have already exhausted all of the available evidence for advanc his thesis. He demonstrates the Augustus/Antony connections thoroughly. The discussion of the great fire of 64 is arrestingly well done: after convincingly present the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stat that despite this preced evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration. It hits you with dramatic effect almost equal to one of the primary sources compris the centerpiece of his proof in this sudden reversal: Tacitus' Annales XV.67.<br /><br />Champlin's organization is somewhat bothersome as it is in \\"Final Judgments,\\" because he rejects chronological arrangement for thematic foci. This requires repetition of several facts, and I cannot understand his reasons for the chapter order. The post-mortem legacy of Nero, be most fascinating, he puts up front obviously to hook his reader. It serves as an interest set piece for further discourse, because the inevitable wonder we feel about Nero's impression on the world ever after demands explanation: thus the rest of the book. But with Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitus unfold the bulk of their own histories so methodically, the rearrangement isn't always a neat fit. Still, Champlin's brilliant weav together of hundreds of sources, as before, vindicates his literary decisions several times over.<br /><br />Champlin, like any other historian, has his hypotheses and directs his evidence toward prov them. His presentation however, is replete with past scholarship and primary sources presented candidly and fairly. One of the most appreciable inclusions is the extensive collection of Latin graffiti, which add a critical dimension to our knowledge. This book has been for me an introduction into full-strength Neronian scholarship and I found it both accessible and empower enough to read further with confidence.ngly present the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stat that despite this preced evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration.

Not the *official* new siddur...,Readers may be confused by the description of this book as the `long-awaited new prayer book' of the Reform movement because of the authorship by Stern. It is not. That siddur is called Mishkan T'filah (Tabernacle of Prayer) and has not yet been made available to the public. No slight intended to Mr. Stern, who has apparently incorporated the same changes agreed by the Reform movement into his version, but this really should be made clear in the description of the book.
Not for the little ones,The pictures in this book are great, but the theme is not for little ones.  In fact, it is a recipe for bad dreams.  My three year old does not need to think about frogs fly in through her window, frogs chas dogs out of the house, and the like at bedtime in a 50's Sci-Fi look.  An award winner for art, yes.  An award winner as a children's story, NO!
A book for the ages,This book is famous for its unique method. It attempts to establish what Hitler knew and when he knew it. In effect, it is written from Hitler's point of view. The events are narrated in the order Hitler experienced them, and as he experienced them. Thus one gets a vivid feel of be present as history unfolds, an experience stolen by \\"omiscient\\" historians and biographers. Of course Irv also includes a huge amount of information gleaned from sometimes exclusive interviews with witnesses and participants. This book has been controversial since it first appeared in the 1970s. It has been publicly criticized by many historians. But it has also been tacitly praised by them, insoar as they have borrowed heavily from Irving's research.
Get the Right Edition,I highly recommend you get this book. Just make sure that you purchase ISBN: 0800757394, the one with the black cover and yellow writing. The other edition is a modern \\"update\\" that has the power of Bosworth's teach stripped from it.
Renew the Shadows,Shadowrun has always been about change, adaptation, and grow from the issues of the past. With each new edition that has arrived since the game's conception back in 1989, a new set of rules, more stream lined, more focused on fun rather than rule mongering, has arisen. Shadowrun 4th edition is the biggest rule change yet.<br /><br />Vet's to the game who enjoyed the game for it's rule's, not it's gam world, have voiced their distaste for the game. I myself was very skeptical of these completely new rules. Let me clarify now, this game has indeed evolved, and these new rules are a step in the right direction. Players of games like Vampire: the Masquarde/the Requiem, Werewolf: the Apocalypse/the Forsaken, and other World of Darkness 1.0 and 2.0 games wil find these rules a bit familiar and comforting.<br /><br />Dice tests are no long single skills with the hopeful add of a combat or specialty dice pool. Instead, tests are made combin attributes and skills into a combined pool, and all tests aim for the same Target Number \\"Hit\\" of 5. Modifiers just add or take away dice now, and the rule of one has been completly reworked.<br /><br />Thus, all vets to the game line will have to learn a whole new set of rules if htey want to stay alive in the shadows, but that's someth they should be used to, adaptation.<br /><br />New Gamers will find these new rule sets much easier to approach than the older sets. While it feels like character creation is more complicated (which is someth shadowrun has been known for), gameplay is smoother, the game suffers less from the same old \\"specialty classes gett so much alone time while they do their th and everyone else gets a big break\\". Instead, with augmented realty (a trend most sci fi groups seem to be tak these days in Cyberpunk games and stories), groups find their Matrix has joined them in the real world.<br /><br />The reason this game loses a star is because there is a standard warn of skepticism. Vets should be warned of the issues with the changed rules. If you loved the rules system and not the game, this isn't an edition you want to pick up. If you want to adapt, and learn a more stream lined system, pick this book up, or go buy the PDF eBook and debate if it's worth your money to buy the physical book follow up.icism.

Problems with this edition,I love Aristotle and this is a good collection, but my book fell apart!  I had a course that used just this book, and despite the fact that we all took good care of our copies, nearly all of our books tore in half or lost pages.  Some actually had to make a new book out of it!
The messenger commits suicide.,While I don't always agree with his TV analysis, I enjoy Mr. Crawford's commentaries. His book, however, is surprisingly shallow and can be summed up in one chapter with footnotes. I didn't realize an intentional misquot of Thomas Jefferson on page 2 (easy enough to catch as the footnote provides the actual quote) was a foreshadow of the paraphras to come. Almost all his sources are the very media he criticizes.    Yes, the media should be astute and critical of anyone in power anywhere, yet it isn't, mostly because it has been corporatized. vilified and because reporters and organizations have wimped out. OK, yes, and....?     Since Crawford is a journalist, one who claims an inside view of what really goes on, he is obligated by the same standards he poses not just to say this is what went on, but to explain why manipulation is allowed and what to do about it. Tom Fenton in his book, Bad News, does a more thorough job of explain the links between money and report and provid a context for media manipulation and journalistic reticence.     Crawford gives specific examples of manipulation, but doesn't provide motive or context beyond the trite \\"politicians manipulate the media so they can look better so they can become powerful.\\" Therein lies the point, if the media is powerful enough that it needs to be manipulated, then it is powerful enough to hold its own. Why hasn't the media held its own and why aren't people demand a real public discussion? What does the messenger do with the message he was supposed to deliver?    Crawford says people are tun to outlets to verify their beliefs so news outlets are becom customer-driven reinforc agents. If that's true, why is the media mak that choice instead of tak the lead? Politicians do attack the messenger, but often they don't have to, because the messenger has been co-opted. More dangerously, by giv hyperbole public time and space, the news media cuts its own throat then calls it a tracheotomy.    Still, despite the flaws, I stayed with the book's limited scope until page 117. \\"I don't vote....\\" With that, Crawford's credibility flew out the window.     \\"I fear it will make it more difficult to keep my observations down the middle.\\" After 116 pages of caterwall about professional and personal responsibility, about the consequences to democracy of a media manipulated by power, about how the media is responsible to its constituents, the public, and should judge both the quality and importance of its \\"message,\\" Crawford absolves himself of any duty, responsibility or personal judgment. His book becomes a version of \\"do as I say, not as I do.\\" Worse yet, the core of his argument is a tautology: journalists must give up the rights and responsibilities of citizenship to uphold the rights and responsibilitites of citizenship. Talk about attack the messenger, the messenger just committed suicide.     Come on, get in the muck with the rest of us, make tough decisions, make judgments. It's in the choos that one gains perspective and insight. Not vot because you're a journalist is like say a Yankee fan can't write about baseball or decid not to eat anything, ever, so no one will know you don't like brocolli.    As Jim Hightower put it, \\"There ain't nothin' in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos.\\"
Let's be realistic,Now that all the friends and family have promoted the book... <br /> <br />In order to understand someth new, we all must relate that which we're learn to that which we already know. <br />Pete and Bill have a difficult time transition from campy comedians to thoughtful educators. To this extent, their writ style lacks any useful analogies whatsoever which might bridge the gap between the known and the unknown. <br /> <br />The book is full of droll and distract fantasy references which are completely irrelevant to the subject matter, and are prone to tak the unsuspect reader off task. <br /> <br />The potential purchaser should also be forewarned that the authors tend towards another immature trait of attempt to impress the reader with their linguistic abilities. Yet, to be effective at teach they should have remembered to never use a complicated word where a simple one will do. <br /> <br />Many examples are rambl and inconcise, where step-by-step quickly degrades into an ambiguous and vague path. <br /> <br />Not every developer can obtain DOMAIN Authority in order to issue SSL certificates and it's too bad that the authors don't allow for this type of scenario, especially when a report system is on a VPN. <br /> <br />All of the content is there, but it's up to the reader to filter and translate most of it from the pitfalls aforementioned into someth more to the center of the bell curve. <br /> <br />
A must own!,Dobson begins her easy-to-read book with chapters appropriately titled \\"Help Your Child Love Learning\\" and \\"Creat Your Own Educational Reform\\". After read just these two chapters I was already in love with the book.<br /><br />The remain chapters consist of reader contributed ideas, lessons and games. These parents know how to make education so fun the kids probably won't even know they are learning! The ideas are easy, fast, inexpensive, and usually involve minimal research.<br /><br />What really makes this book stand far and above others is Table 2.2, found on pages 34-37. This helpful table lists many popular off-the-shelf curriculums that can be easily recreated at home with materials you already have, or can be found used - all for under $100!<br /><br />This book is truly ingenious! It's about time someone organized the ideas of creative parents into one handy reference. I cannot think of a better person to present this material other a personal favorite, Linda Dobson.
Useful stories & ideas, presentation lacking,I have been listen to many of these Sounds True and similar audiocassettes recently, look for good meditation material.  Fortunately, since the exploration is pretty hit-or-miss for me, the Seattle library has a lot of them (includ this one), so I am able to preview them.  For my taste, The Second Half of Life is better in its intention than its execution.  Overall, for my money, a more successful work (also available both at Amazon and the Seattle library) is A Woman's Spiritual Retreat: Teaching, Meditations, and Rituals to Celebrate Your Authentic Feminine Wisdom, by Joan Borysenko.  Although it focuses primarily on women's wisdom and growth, as opposed to second-half-of-life wisdom and growth, it hits a lot of the same notes and also draws on myth and ritual.  (Another, much shorter work in a similar vein that I also found more successful is the meditation CD, Celtic Spirit Meditations, by Mara Freeman--also available at Amazon and reviewed by me here.)     Certainly, the intention of The Second Half of Life is to help people do some positive growth in their later years, draw on wisdom of many cultures, and as the positive reviews attest, it does accomplish this very well for some people.  However, for me, Ms. Arrien picks some good myths, tales and themes for her foundation, but then doesn't do enough substantive and rigorous work with them.  The basic pattern (except for the Preferential Shapes exercise, see below) is to tell a tale or introduce a character or concept, give her interpretation (which often seems either too simplistic and schematic or too arbitrary, as other reviewers have noted), and then to say, \\"So where am I with __________ in my life?\\" [Fill in the blank with the theme or symbol just discussed.] The psychologiz offered, although constructive, seems--well, mostly self-evident.  To someone who grew up lov much of the original source material in its pure, story form, some of the interpretations actually diminish the stories'inherent symbolic meaning.      I did find both the description and the interpretation of the Nine Muses pretty good, and was pleased to come across a theme I'd been look for but hadn't found elsewhere (except in Layne Redmond's wonderful music CD Invok the Muse, also available on Amazon).  The Pandora's Box story has an interest comparison of this myth in different cultures (includ what was left in the bottom of the box, accord to the different cultures).  The Preferential Shapes section gives you someth specific to do, an exercise with your preferences for five universal shapes. I found this exercise to provide some helpful insights, albeit in a fortune-tell kind of way.  The 12 Labors of Hercules got a retell that was somehow both cursory and redundant, and the interpretations here felt especially arbitrary and forced to me.  Like another reviewer, I found the Eight Gates rather suspect in how Ms. Arrien drew together elements supposedly from many sources to arrive at this particular interpretation (and I also could have done without the gnomes!), although there is some good material about initiation and transition here.  Overall, there seems to be a lot of focus on schematic, numbered, arbitrary hierarchies.     I also found the material overall to be too repetitive and slow-moving, and like another reviewer with the same problem, was irked by the verbal delivery (the uneven rhythm, the tone, and a tendency to do repetitions of phrases that did not feel naturally emphatic and became quite irritating).  It would be nice if Amazon would provide not only the Search Inside This Book function for books on tape (sadly miss here), so that people can get an idea of the specific content and tone, but also audioclips for books on tape, as they do for music CDs.  These audiocassettes are often quite pricey, and long, and one's personal reaction to the voice of the narrator is pretty important.  The Sounds True website does have audio samples formany of their authors' items, includ this one.
An Interest Outsider's Look at North Korea,This short graphic novel by French Canadian Guy Delisle managed to be humorous and frighten at once. It's a story of his two-month stay in Pyongyang while oversee the production of a popular French children's cartoon. Delisle is not lost on the sad irony of his position, and tells his story simply and without pretense.<br /><br />The book deals mainly with how frustrat life is in the capital, even for a privileged foreigner like him: bad food, constant surveillance, blar propanda songs, etc.<br /><br />It's probably most affect when you get a real sense of the inner lives of his guide and translator. Both are very buttoned-up, proper and repressed. At one point Delisle lends one of them his copy of \\"1984\\"; when the guy returns it a week later he seems very nervous and mutters someth about how he \\"doesn't like science fiction.\\" On the other hand, he rejoices when he gets a bottle of Hennessy as a going-away present.<br /><br />In the most terrify episode Delisle asks his guide where all the handicapped people are in Pyongyang, and the guide responds that there aren't any handicapped people in North Korea. Yikes!<br /><br />Highly recommended to any fan of first-person graphic journalism.
Nutrients for Neuropathy,Some more usual information for neuropathy sufferers laid out in an easy to understand and follow format. This book in the series does not have so many other personal case histories as the other two publications and was not as useful to me.
A Must Read But Some Caveats,It is to Jane Hyun's credit to discuss issues of Asian American professionals on a very practical level. There are however, some caveats for the reader. The book needs to be contextualized within a larger conceptual framework. The overarch issues are ignored within her practical framework, namely: Who needs to change? Who needs to accommodate whom?  How much? What are the risks and benefits? Her book appears to be say that corporate America needs to understand Asians, but it does not need to change.  Rather it is the Asian professional that needs to change and adapt. <br /> <br />Is the book too heavily assimilationist?  It is not clear as Hyun does make a distinction early in her book between assimilation (\\"adopt ...at the expense of one's own cultural characteristics\\") and acculturation (\\"adapt ...while continu to maintain values, perspectives, and features of one's native culture\\"). <br /> <br />There appears to be little adaptation of any Asian models or perspective to the mainstream USA corporate culture -- page 279 suggests two ways: \\"Develop cultural competency\\" and \\"Make use of your bicultural and bilingual abilities.\\" While recogniz the dominance of USA/Western research and models in the business world, it is also logical and no \\"one model fits all.\\" Perhaps future research and practices can provide indigenous Asian models or perspectives that can be adapted and work effectively in coporate America or other cultures.  The Special Issue on China & India (Business Week, August 22/29, 2005) points out how some USA business models are not applicable. <br /> <br />It is not an either/or proposition.  By utiliz the juxtaposition of the Asian behavior/values system versus the Western behavior/values system to present her central thesis, Hyun creates a false dichotomy in the mind of the reader. Current business literature is filled with exhortations of \\"win/win,\\" \\"both/and,\\" \\"alignment,\\" and \\"interdependence\\" -- all very Asian concepts. These traditional Asian cultural values are at the very heart of what contemporary corporate America is try to effect in order to add value. So there is a \\"baby with the bath water\\" caveat here to the reader.  The accommodation needs to be reciprocal, not unilateral. <br /> <br />In her Epilogue, Hyun encourages the reader to \\"Develop an Action Plan That Works with Your Persona.\\"  It seems throughout her book that the emphasis is on ask the reader to tailor his or her persona to that which is required for success in corporate America, not on utiliz the behavioral strengths and cognitive positions with which someone who comes with a strong Asian cultural background is imbued.  Be Asian -- it seems to Hyun -- puts one in a deficit position. <br /> <br />The reader needs to be cautious in the self-assessment, individual profiles, exercises and tools cited. They yield helpful descriptive self-awareness profiles and information, not diagnostic or predictive profiles, and they are dependent on situational factors. There are many suggestions, based perhaps on many years of experience, but empirical data demonstrat their reliability, validity or efficacy are not mentioned. <br /> <br />Kudos to Hyun for encourag the seek of regular and frequent performance feedback. This is a career self-monitor technique that is utilized far too little by all employees to help document and strengthen requests for job and salary advancement.  In spite of the conceptual conundrums, this highly practical book is a must read. <br /> <br />Adrian Chan (Kochman Mavrelis Associates, Oak Park, IL) & Barry Mar (Management & Resources Associates, Seattle, WA) <br />
Not really what I was look for,Child like projects.  Look for someth a little more advanced.  Didn't find a project I would use.  Although, I may use some of the patterns on other items.
Beautiful,Rumi needs no praise from me and Barks' translation is beautiful, mysterious, and urgent.  I find his introductions to the many sections especially moving.  My only problem is that I ordered the book after I bought Barks' \\"The Essential Rumi,\\" which changed me.  This book has many overlaps.  I'd have preferred to see more original translations, but as a first introduction, you can do no better.
Lone Classicist,The Denniston text is an extremely useful resource that any classicist should have in front of them when work with primary source materials from ancient Greece.  The organization of the book facilitates ease of use, and the entries are filled with examples taken from antiquity.  Compar the entries on particles in Denniston with those in Smyth greatly add another level of understand to the project of translation.
Big and Comprehensive,Just want to clarify how to  use the Emanuel Contracts book:<br /><br />I recommend it as a semester-long guide. This will help you flesh out the varied topics and clarify them as you are read your casebook. This book recommends read your casebook first, then referr to the same topics in this volume to ensure you understand the material--this should be done before you encounter the material in class, preferably.<br /><br />If you're look for someth to pick up midway dur the semester or just before finals, I think the Crunchtime series by the same publisher is a better choice.
Interesting,Although not quite what I expected, this book was far from be a disappointment.  It is not solely focused on women dressed as angels, it is mainly an erotic Fantasy Photography book.  9 photographers from North-central europe are featured, with more than 10 photographs from each.  Styles differ, from body-paint (for a comic-book effect) to completely photoshopped settings and landscapes, to a contortionist/dancer - but always the theme remains, the female in ways you probably have not seen before.
Recalcitrant Indecisiveness,This book explores several themes. First, it speaks in generalities to the rise of the Profession of Arms and talks about the development of professional officers. The second major theme is that it dicusses command and control and the execution and management of violence. the thesis is that decision making, technology and professionalism are essential tools that now become part of the overall thought, deliberate strategy plann and development process of the military. Thirdly, it speaks to and explores tactical decisiveness and lastly, it speaks to international law and custom.<br /><br />All in all this is a great book, but dont expect that the conclusions or answers to these themes will always jump out at you. You will need to read with intention to discern these 4 themes, and some others, and how they may or may not apply to your contemporary comparisons of Modern war, that is from roughly WW II to the Gulf War of 90-91 and Post-Modern War, that is, current warfare post 9-11.<br /><br />This two hundred year work of analysis ends where it begins. With the analysis of a decisive battle. The last 8 pages sum up a few of the auhtors conclusions; one that comes to mind is the political-military-business train and role that officers must have in order to perform there military roles effectively.<br /><br />The greatest benefit of this book will be derived when one compares post modern war with the tactical lessons of the battlefield.<br /><br />The academic debate rages, and will continue to rage over whether or not there is such a th as the decisive battle. You will need to discern for yourself if the principles of war have changed and if the tactical execution of the battle has a direct correlation to the operational, strategic and or political aspects of war.<br /><br />ps. read this book slowly and with intention, there is much to absorb here.<br /><br />Terry Tucker, Prof Military Studies/History<br /><br />Senior Doctrine Developer SANGMP
Best book on writing...,Pound for pound, this may be the best book on, about, or for aspir writers.   <br /> <br />I have read at least 10 books on the craft of writ and a bunch on theory and technique... this book is right up there with the best of the best.  If you couple this book with Raymond Carver's posthumous \\"Call if You Need Me\\" and mix in a few careful readings of any Richard Yates interview, you've got yourself some tough rope to tow.  But if you want to be a strong writer, suck it up and do it anyway! <br /> <br />I hold a BA in fiction writing.  I also tend to write literary realist fiction.  If you are of the same mind, this book will help you tremendously.  It is brutal in it's explanation of what to steer clear of and what to include, but that is how it should be.  If you take writ very seriously, and want to take it to the next level, this book is a great start. <br /> <br />You can't go wrong when you have advice from C. Michael Curtis (Fiction Editor of the most prominent publication in America) and Frank Conroy (Chairman to the most prestegious writ institute in America.)  Pay attention folks.  This is the real deal.  Add in some very helpful workshop activites from one Tom Bailey (only a head writ professor at Harvard) and some very heartfelt tips from a true master like Dubus... Forget about it! <br /> <br />\\"On becom a Novelist\\" was good.  \\"ABCs of Reading\\" was good.  \\"The Lonely Voice\\" was decent.  Forster's guidance was revolutionary, but this book is perfect for now.  Go buy it and then read all the Carver and Yates and Dubus and Wolff you can get your grubby little hands on.  You'll be a better writer for it.  Trust me!
A Great Read For Anyone!,This book is a great read for market researchers and the general population alike.  Dr. McEwen has put together a truly compell \\"tale\\" of how certain brands entice followings, and how or why said followings are either maintained and groomed, or discarded.  A fascinat cultural study, as well as a meticulous scientific one, this is a great present for anyone who's ever wondered how Disney or Coca Cola has come to the prominence they enjoy today.  To have put together so much information in such a fun, readable way is Dr. McEwen's true gift, and he should be lauded for it.  Bravo!
Warmed over leftovers,To his discredit, Dr. Unwin virtually brags in the introductory chapter that nearly all of the questions and arguments that have mystified pterosaurs since their discovery have been answered in recent years,  but when it comes time to reveal those answers, Unwin typically sidesteps. Origins? Still not sure. Family tree? With over a hundred genera to choose from,  and many recently discovered, Unwin falls back on a favorite few and places them on an antique tree, not a modern cladogram. While Unwin's writ style is refresh and easy to read (every chapter opens with short fiction), and his photos are first rate, the line work is rarely original and never detailed. Almost noth is shown from the neck down. Only skulls are presented. Most, if not all, of the drawings  are recognizable from other sources. So, a disappointed reader here.
Beware the positive reviews!,<br />This book should be illegal for be hideously dangerous to your health, but the first amendment does allow this abhorrent man to publish his little book. <br /> <br />In regards to the positive review I just read, please note that \\"The Lost Reviewer\\"'s critique is an obvious puff-piece.  Check out the other reviews under the same name of 'Kelvin' and you'll find an Oct. 11 review of the same book that is completely scathing.  Hmmm...be paid to write reviews, are we?  Amazon should take action on this. <br /> <br />Only the very gullible or desperate will buy this book.  I wouldn't use it as toilet paper.
Highly Recommended!,When sports figures write books on leadership, they often take the easy route - athletic metaphors, game time war stories, tenuous applications of sports experiences to business. This refresh book breaks through such superficial ideas as decisively as a dunk by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in his prime. Ten-time national champion UCLA basketball coach John Wooden - generally considered the greatest college basketball coach to ever hold a clipboard - delivers a leadership book that stands alone at center court. Remarkably, none of Wooden's players recall him urg them to win. Instead, he urged them to do their best every moment. Take care of the process, he says, and the result will take care of itself. To Wooden, preparation is pivotal and every detail matters. Despite his almost obsessive focus on gett the little things right, Wooden believes in balance and consistency. He avoids extremes. Wooden's long-time collaborator and co-author Steve Jamison does a wonderful job of portraying, through the coach, a range of qualities, philosophies and characteristics that apply to every field. We strongly recommend this book to managers and executives who want to know how to lead people to victory in every game.
Packed with Knowledge!,Details, details, details. That's really what successful event plann is all about, and that's the key to this very successful event-plann manual. Author Judy Allen notes, lists, copes with and gives an example of virtually every detail in plann anyth from a sedate corporate event in a major city to a huge celebration on a remote island. She provides examples galore plus tips, questions and answers, sample cost sheets and schedules. How much floor space does a person need to be comfortable in a tent? Answer: 20 square feet. How many bathrooms should be available for a party? Answer: One per 75 guests. And don't forget to ask about the stemware, adequate park and even the photographer's back-up camera battery. This author seems to have thought every contingency, as the book's ambitious title promises. Her one glar omission is that she does not include the party planner's fee - our guess is that she'd be worth it. We highly recommend this well-organized, very practical book to all event planners. Don't send out press releases for your party without consult Judy Allen.
Truly a waste of your time,If you are truly a fan of Kate Bush and her music, DO NOT buy this book.  Although its title and photos depict Kate, this novel is not about her.  It's plot revolves around the tedious wanderings and musings of a depressed individual with low self esteem and body dimorphism.  As other reviewers have already commented, this is really two books.  The first is the whinings of the painfully depressed narrator, the second, interspersed randomly with the first, is an opinionated biography of Kate.  I suspect that the author is not actually a fan of Kate, and that he only used her name, history, and likeness to capitalize on an established base of fans who are hungry for anyth new.  Shame on him.  My only hope is that Kate actually reads this drivel and sues him for associat her with such a piece of trash.  Don't waste your time and money.  If you truly want to know about Kate Bush, buy her albums and check out some of the web sites created by her fans.  John Mendelssohn, if you read this, on behalf of everyone who has purchased and read this book, I demand our time and money back.
Teach Everyone the Rules for Success,After circl the traits I possessed on page 59 in the \\"Framework for Understand Poverty\\" and find out I fell mostly in poverty, it was no wonder I got along better with these students than my colleagues.<br /><br />This book not only helps teachers understand their students, but helps teachers to understand themselves and how they relate to children. By understand our behaviors and the behaviors of our students, we can move beyond conflicts and toward achievement.<br /><br />This book is entertaining, informative and career changing.
beautiful, but preaches mostly to the converted,It is a lovely book... somewhat surreal and definitely Utopian in theme but Bryant takes you so gently and slowly to her thesis that it's ultimately easy-to-swallow. Reflection over time, however, yields a few problems.  <br />As another reviewer has pointed out, Bryant uses a dispicable character to explain and augment the premise for the culture of Ata; many readers will find it hard to sympathize with his supposed enlightenment. Also, the id is completely glossed over in this book, the idea be that  proper socialization within such a  Utopian culture would erase or negate animalistic urges down to permanently manageable magnitude; many readers will question her conclusion in that regard and doubts will emerge on the entire premise. Lastly, the protagonists obtuse nature makes the book plod a bit; many readers will \\"get it\\" right away and be annoyed with how long it takes the main character to catch up (which in some respects he never really does) <br /> <br />Then there's the attitude of the Kin of Ata themselves. While beautiful and lov and empathic and yadda yadda, they can easily come across as lackadaisical or just plain apathetic. While much is made of their near-telepathic \\"oneness\\" and reliance upon their spiritual nature, their repeated indulgence of the main character becomes tiresome.... have they no self-preservation? No passion? No overrid discipline? These questions are best exemplified by the fact that the Ata see no benefit from the notion of the written word. Much is made of their connection to one another; their oral history that becomes the art of storytell etc. Apparently, historical fact-keep is anathema to Utopia. I found that notion to be impossible to accept. Within the framework of a people absolutely cut-off from \\"modern\\" societies influence perhaps that could MAYBE be true, but one does not simply dismiss an obstacle to spiritual awaken by push it out of view. This comes across as a basic ostrich manuever to avoid fac the difficult realities of human natures: heirarchical thinking, competiveness and basic surivival needs that when unmet turn to aggression and antagonistic behavior. Those may not be pleasant realities but they are realities. <br /> <br />For a more interest (and possibly more intellectual) take on the same notion, try out Herland by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Although her victorian attitudes about female sexuality date the piece, all other aspects of her Utopia seem more plausible to me. Which is say something, really.  <br /> <br />Actually, I'd be more enthusiastic to recommend The Dispossessed (or nearly anyth by Ursula K LeGuin) or Wild Seed (or nearly anyth by Octavia Butler) as both (the books and the writers) explore the notion of a Utopian ideal by hand it to humanity via an alien race who are well aware of the not-so-nice aspects of human nature. Both writers understand that some unsavory elements are iron-clad stuck in us, not just taught to us.  <br /> <br />By keep the Utopianists as human as anyone else, we beg the question \\"why do those humans never fight, never hurt each other and how would they deal with a natural disaster?\\" which never seems to be answered by Utopian writers adequately. By beginn enlightenment with an outside species/race, we change the question to \\"can humanity resist its negative tendancies in order to accept this Utopia?\\" which is imminently more interest and quite possibly answerable on some level.  <br /> <br />The Kin of Ata... neither addresses nor firmly answers these questions, which is it's only flaw. For fantasy, however, it sure is a wonderful read.
wealth of information,Not a beginners book, but a more advanced grimoire for the solitary practitioner.  Spells, rituals and practice covers a wide range of needs - circle casting, Esbat rituals, Sabbat Rituals, meditations, basic spells, to clean your crystals and divinations.  She also goes into teas, oils and baths, the foundation for the aromatherapy crazy.  Each divided into well organized, easy-to-follow sections.<br /><br />As with all the Green Witchcraft series, there is a wealth of information just not for the crafter, but endless material to help writers of the paranormal and fantasy categories.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
The only book that give details, and not politics, behind tax plans,This book is well written and a focused book that looks at chang a terrible tax policy inflict the American People.  I read this book after hear so much positive and negative around this issue.  <br /> <br />After read it, I have found that most of the \\"negative\\" reviews of the fair tax, and the book,  have NO relationship to the Plan or to the book. It seems that there are politics go on in how some people, includ some of the reviewers, interpret the \\"fair tax\\". Instead of review the book, they are mak political statements that meet their needs often twist the plan or compar it to other plans (i.e. VAT) that are false. <br /> <br /> The book specifically addresses the facts and states there is no Plan that is perfect and there is no free lunch.  I recommend you read the book and make up your own mind.   <br />
This should be on every therapist's bookshelf,This is a book you have to have. It's an `I can't put it down' book. It makes you wonder how you ever managed to work with traumatized clients without it. It makes you realise why you weren't gett anywhere, why what you were do in therapy wasn't good enough to help clients move on from their past trauma. <br /> <br />Traditionally therapy with this group of clients focussed heavily on the trauma. This book takes the reader beyond that. For once a book is look at more than just the trauma in the past as someth to be dealt with. It shows the reader why difficulties today must be tackled in a different way when the client has a trauma history than with other clients. But it opens your eyes to ways to work with other clients too. <br /> <br />When I am asked to recommend a book for therapists with trauma clients this is the one I choose. It is the only book that helps one understand why everyday life is so difficult for such clients, someth no other book does in such depth or in such a useful way. Read this book is like wak up to what life is really like for this group of clients; you will never see a client in the same way again. Now you will know why they behave as they do, why mak changes is so difficult and why what works with other client groups doesn't work so well when the client comes from an abusive or neglectful family. <br /> <br />Steve Gold shows clearly how incidents of abuse are set within a family context that does not provide the tools for deal with everyday life in an effective manner. Because of the general family context in which ongo abuse occurs, these clients have always lacked vital cop mechanisms and abilities that are usually learned dur an adequate childhood. The model proposed gives one a framework to work effectively and help the client face both the fears of the past and the fears of today. It places the trauma process within a therapy that enables the client to grow rather than stay focussed on trauma alone. It provides the reader with a model to use to effectively understand, assess and teach the vital abilities that were never taught in childhood. It opens your eyes to the context in which these clients developed all their strategies to cope, ones that do not help them now.   <br /> <br />This is a book that mustn't be missed. It is one you will take off the shelf again and again. Whatever DSM category your client fits into, if they have problems that arose from a traumatic childhood this is the book to guide you. It is the most important book you will ever buy. <br /> <br />
Simple, entertaining!,Never been much for enjoy history, but the style, brevity, and choice of subject matter come together very nicely in this book.
Attention: Only read the new translation by Tim Wilkinson,Anyone who reads the poor first translation of Fateless and the shamefully bad translation of Kaddish cannot even get close to the true spirit of the original works. <br />Thanks to Tim Wilkinson English speakers can finally enjoy these excellent books.  <br />Look for the titles \\"Fatelessness\\" and \\"Kaddish for an Unborn Child\\", both translated by Wilkinson. These new editions are at last worthy of the originals and the Nobel Prize. <br />(See also October 16, 2002 review by Marton Sass) <br />A movie based on the novel Fateless is also out with English subtitles; don't miss it, if you have a chance. Beautiful work. <br />
A Must Read,This is a great read. Everyone should read this, especially if you're one of the few to notice what Levy has pointed out. I've been talk about some of these issues mentioned for a few years now. Or whenever Britney Spears,  Christina Aguliera, Jessica Simpson, and Sex and the City burst onto the pop culture radar. <br /> <br />Levy's writ style is easy to read, not at all distract like some other writers in this genre, like Naomi Wolf, who take the focus off the material. I really apreciate the chapter devoted to the women's movement since I was born years after and the women's studies class i recently took failed to cover it. That chapter puts some things in perspective for me. Read this book. You will not be disappointed.
Grandmum does it again,Grandmum was a children's librarian and always finds the great books for my daughter.<br /><br />This is a sweet little book that has become my daughters favorite(she is 4).  She found it funny that a cat, a squirrel and a duck would live together, play music, and make soup.<br /><br />Each has a part to their events as each plays a certain instrument, and each has a certain part to the mak of the soup.<br /><br />Chaos happens when the duck decides he wants to try someth different.<br /><br />It of course has a happy ending.<br /><br />The art is very good as my daughter likes look at it.<br /><br />A good book for bed time reading!
PART ENGLISH HISTORY...PART ENGLISH MYSTERY...,This is a marvelous and beautifully realized work of fiction. As someone who enjoys mysteries, as well as historical fiction and gothic novels of suspense, I was quite taken with this book. Intricately plotted, the book is clever in its premise. Two disparate human beings, a highly independent, red-headed slip of a woman, Samantha Flood, Australian by birth, and a serious, fervently religious Spaniard, Miguel Madero, who is half-English, find themselves thrust together, as each explores the tiny, remote Cumbrian village of Illthwaite in England, look for answers to their individual quests.  Both are in Illthwaite to get information relative to that which each is seeking. Both are stay in the local inn, called The Stranger House.<br /><br />Samantha is a brilliant but brash mathematician in her early twenties. Fondly known as Sam to her friends, she is interested in trac her familial roots. She has recently discovered that her paternal grandmother was from this part of the world,  hav been a part of a huge number of children migrants that had been unceremoniously shipped from England to other parts of its Empire, includ Australia. Samantha is interested in find out more about her paternal grandmother and the mystery surround her.<br /><br />Miguel, or Mig, as he is known to his family and friends, is the scion of a well-known house of vintners in Spain and is in his late twenties. He is a former seminarian who has suffered from manifestations of what he believes to be stigmata. He also, on occasion, sees ghostly manifestations or visions. Recover from a serious alpine accident that nearly killed him, he is now in Illthwaite ostensibly to do research  for his thesis on the experience of English Catholics dur the Reformation. He is, however, actually in Illthwaite to find out more about an ancestor of his who mysteriously disappeared there centuries ago dur the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.<br /><br />In Illthwaite, Both Sam and Mig find themselves up against obstacles placed in their way. It seems that its residents are not totally forthcom or are reluctant to part with information relative to their respective quests. What they each individually discover is that things are not always as they seem in Illthwaite.  Moreover, their divergent interests are more intertwined than they could ever have imagined. They will discover that they have more in common than they realized, hav come full circle in a cosmic design not of their making.<br /><br />This book has well-drawn characters that come alive under the author's expert hand. The plot is unusual, as well as complex, contain many layers that the discern reader will enjoy exploring. Well-written, as well as intricately plotted, this book crosses a number of genres. With its supernatural portents, historical underpinnings, underly mystery, as well as its gothic type  suspense and sensibilities, infused with just a dollop of  romance, this book will appeal to those readers who favor these genres. In particular, I found the parts of the book that transcended into historical fiction to be the most compelling. This is not a book for everyone, but to  those for whom its themes have inherent appeal, it is a book to be relished.mselves up against obstacles placed in their way.

immigrant's support,As someone who came to the United States fresh after college in the mid-eighties, I pondered the question of my new identity and American identity in general quite often. I picked Mr. Huntington's book in the summer of 2005 and found it to be very enlightening. I find it undeniable the fact that at the origin of the success of America as a nation and a state lies her British, protestant origins. That origin set the tone of the work ethic, legal system, democratic representation. One can find further confirmation of this thesis in the splendid \\"The History of the American People\\" by British historian Paul Johnson. Samuel Huntington points out that until early sixties immigrants arriv in the USA were assisted by the government in their assimilation process. The English language instructions were easily available and no one found offensive the premise that the command of the english language was essential to fully function as an American. Since then, the \\"assimilation\\" became a bad word and government's assistance started to look like discrimination. These days, in the name of diversity and political correctness, any government program has a counter-assimilation effects. The bilingual education of Hispanics, for example, only postpones their entry into the English speak world. Compare the fate of Hispanic youth receiv their education in Spanish with that of young children arriv from Eastern Europe, Russia or Asia. With no bilingual education available to those kids, their succesful transition into English speak world is almost instantenous.    While discuss three major social theories, Mr. Huntington clearly makes a case for a \\"tomato soup with garnishings\\" model (with tomatos represent anglo-protestant core values with garnishings provided by non-anglo immigrant groups). Once hoped for, \\"melt pot\\" model, is not really happening. What seems to be happening, however, is that the ris cultural awareness of individual ethnic groups and lack of assimilation programs leads us towards a \\"tossed salad\\" type of a society.    The book raises reader's awarenes of the social procesess that take place. Unfortunately, it can only do just that. The sheer force of the sociodemographic change in the US is probably impossible to control and the anglo-protestant core of values will get dilluted and all but disappear.
Live on your feet or die on your knees,Mr. Andersons' book provides a thorough examination, diagnosis, and best possible cure for what ails black america. Not poor whites, hispanics, arabs, jews, gays, or white women. You owe it to you and your family to at least check out the facts of this examination and then decide.  <br /> <br />White america has always put their modus operandi in our face; this is our society, these are our rules, do the best you can with what we decide to give you; don't bother me while I make my money. If you do, the police will handle you. <br /> <br />Here is Black americas' call to focus on what should have been the legacy of civil rights - economic empowerment.
Great for insight!,This book gives a great description of what liv with Fibro is like. It helped me not feel so alone with my illness and realize that others do have similiar symptoms. If I had read this book earlier it would have saved me from a needless bladder surgery that did more harm than good.
Honestly written!,This is one of the best books on how people cope with Fibro that I have read. This man is honest about how he feels and how he struggles in his role as caretaker of an ill spouse. It helped give me insight into what my husband must go through in help to keep me sane and well as this illness steals both our lives.
Great!!,I use the ideas in this book in my work with women try to break out of dysfunctional relationships. They have no clue what a real one is and how to develop one. This helps with all types of relationships they must have.
Preposterous,Early in this novel, our hero finds out that a container of antimatter has been hidden somewhere in the Vatican, and that if he doesn't find it in time, the city will be blown sky-high.  I could think of one obvious place the antimatter might have been stowed. I turned to my other half and said, \\"Mark my words. The antimatter will be found (insert spoilers here).\\"  <br /> <br />And, of course, it was. And so I got rather sick of Robert Langdon miss the obvious hid place and instead blunder around Rome, wast precious time, and narrowly fail to rescue various Church luminaries. I wanted to smack him--none of the cardinals need have died if Langdon had been able to figure out the SECRET HIDING PLACE that I figured out at once.  And I'm not a Harvard professor. <br /> <br />Add to that Langdon's completely implausible escape from certain death, which was the sort of th that only works in the movies. I'd love to see Myth Busters poke holes in that scene. Langdon would have been toast. <br /> <br />I'll leave it to others to point out holes in Brown's art history; it's been a long time since I took art history and I'll admit I'm rusty.  As for me, I'll just say that the plot managed to be both over-the-top and dull at the same time. Also, don't you just *love* Dan Brown's \\"strong\\" female characters who seem to do very little other than wear skimpy clothing, get kidnapped, get rescued, and fulfill the hero's yoga-goddess fantasies? <br /> <br />Ugh.
This book surprised me!,Prior to read this book, I didn't think I had major limit beliefs but the exercises that Cole-Whittaker takes you through helped me uncover some I hadn't even realized I had. <br /> <br />If someth has kept you from reach your potential and you can't quite figure out what, pick up this book and uncover your personal obstacles. <br /> <br />Cole-Whittaker is a minister and does refer to God often in the book. If that bothers you, try to figure out a way to get around the references because this book may do wonders for you. I personally subscribe to the Higher Power so it was fine with me.
A bless to the nations,This attractively illustrated book provides a showcase of Israel's achievements in fields as diverse as agriculture, education, medicine, science and technology. It looks at the technologies, processes and the products from this tiny little land that are improv the lives of so many people. The authors highlight some of the people responsible for this ingenuity that is benefit the whole world.<br /><br />For example, at the Weizmann Institute, Dr Michal Schwartz has developed a way of harness immune system cells to repair and revive damaged nerve fibres. Other medical breakthroughs include the miniscule camera-in-a-tablet used for internal diagnosis, ultrasound for destroy tumours and Israel's highly effective disaster relief operations.<br /><br />A great help to third world people has been the discovery by scientist Yoel Margalith of the Bti bacterium that kills certain kinds of flies and harmful mosquitoes.  This has already saved millions of livers and is an environment-friendly intervention. Most remarkable is that Margalith is a holocaust survivor, of both the Bergen-Belsen and Teresienstadt camps.<br /><br />In many fields Israel is so far ahead of the pack that other countries have no chance of catch up. One of the most interest innovations developed in Israel is a project to avoid collisions between aircraft and migratory birds. It involved the study of the flight paths of birds. This work of researcher Yossi Leshem is now also used by the Jordanian and Turkish air-force.<br /><br />Israel has more engineers per capita than any other country on earth and a remarkable number of hi-tech companies. Innovation in the fields of computers and information technology is particularly impressive. This encompasses software, operat systems, storage & retrieval systems, verification and firewall technologies, plus a host of mobile phone applications.<br /><br />Israel's creativity is not restricted to science and technology, as there is also much happen in arts and culture. Despite its small size and its many enemies, this country is burst with creative energy and mak a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.<br /><br />The founders of this brave country were aware that Israel had almost no natural resources and that its people therefore had to develop and apply their brainpower. Well, they are succeed spectacularly. What a pity that Israel has to devote so much of its money and resources to protect itself from its neighbours! If its full genius were given free reign, it would become even more of a bless to the world.ts small size and its many enemies, this country is burst with creative energy and mak a huge contribution to the global marketplace and to quality of life worldwide.

An informed explanation of the structure and logic of the early Christian interpretations of scripture in late antiquity,The collaborative work of John J. O'Keefe and R. R. Reno (both of whom are Associate Professors of Theology at Creighton University), Sanctified Vision: An Introduction To Early Christian Interpretation Of The Bible provides the reader with an informed explanation of the structure and logic of the early Christian interpretations of scripture in late antiquity. These interpretations are considered foundational to the development of Christianity as a religion, and offer insight into how these early leaders and theologians thought about doctrine and practice by analyz selected portions of patristic exegesis to illustrate specific read techniques used by them to expound the mean they believed intrinsic to biblical texts. The approach utilized in Sanctified Vision is organized around three basis analytical strategies: literal, typological, and allegorical. Within this framework, Professors O'Keefe and Reno cogently argue for the importance of this analytic framework and structure in understand the emergence of what was to become Christian theological orthodoxy. A work of impeccable scholarship and also available in a hardcover edition (0801880874, $45.00), Sanctified Vision will be of immense interest and value to students of Christian Theology, Christian History, and Biblical Studies.
Wonderful train book!,I saw this book at a client's house while there to give their Lab a private lesson.  As a clicker trainer, I am usually wary of train books because so many of them give outdated advice. What a wonderful surprise this book turned out to be! It is filled with dead-on, fabulous advice & is written in a clear, easy to read style. It is enhanced by plenty of photos and illustrations, as well. I was particularly impressed by the inclusion of items such as Calm Signals!  I highly recommend this book for  owners of any breed dog who want to learn to train & communicate with their dog in the most effective and humane way. I plan to buy this book to offer for sale in my dog obedience school.
Please read this, the book was very poorly done,I feel bad say this, but I was severely disappointed with this book. As a physician and early American history buff I was really look forward to learn more about Benjamin Rush.<br /><br />In general it seems that the author, despite putt out what appears to be a finished, presentable biography, never really dug into source materials to find out who Benjamin Rush was and why he was important.  Repeatedly, we hear of Rush's fame and accomplishments and influence, but the details are missing.<br /><br />We hear what a great doctor Rush was, considered the preeminent physician of his times, accord to the author, but all the author writes about is how Rush tortured his patients with medical treatments we now know are harmful, such as bloodletting, giv cathartics, etc.  Rush is known as the \\"Father of American Psychiatry\\", his book on psychiatry was bible for many many years, and his observations on mental illness were in many ways way way ahead of his times...yet not a word of this is mentioned except in the last ten pages of this 365 page book.  This subject desperately needed to explained.  This is why he is important for heaven's sake.<br /><br />Furthermore, I think it would have been fascinat to have gotten a better feel for what bloodlett and giv cathartics was about, we needed some good old source material, firsthand observations and then-current thoughts, as well as an expose of the tools employed, etc.  Rush, it is clear, considered himself first and foremost and physician.  He dedicated his life to the practice of medicine, he was considered a top academic lecturer.  We are told all the top American physicians for the next half century were either disciples of Rush or disciples of his students.....but we don't really get a feel for why.<br /><br />His political contributions and inolvement were similarly neglected.  Although he wasn't the political calibre of Hamilton or Jefferson, he was definitely a major player.  Much of the earlier portion of the biography seemed to focus on explain the political events occurr around Rush dur the fight for independence.  The focus should have been Rush.  There's a lot of negativity surround Rush early on in the book, but how he seems to know all the important figures in the Revolution and why they respect him is not explained.<br /><br />There also weren't any pictures or illustrations.  I could go on.  On the bright side, at least the book reads well.  If you want to learn more about Rush, you should probably choose another book.  Sorry.
Rivet Arthurian retelling!,I have searched and searched for a great Arthurian retell and have been disappointed with the ones I have ventured into reading. I was somewhat skeptical when I picked up Nancy McKenzie's Queen of Camelot. This two-novels-in-one compilation is based on Guenevere, from her point of view, in first person narrative, and is 623 pages long in very small print. I didn't want to waste my time read someth this big only to be disappointed at the end. I nevertheless gave the book a whirl. Glad I did! This is one of the most compell and beautifully told retells I have ever read! McKenzie gives us a detailed story about Guenevere from her point of view. She tells us about the prophecy on the day she was born, how she spends her childhood as an adventurous tomboy, how people fear her and treat her differently as she grows up, how the knights around her battle with the Saxons, and how all of the prophecies come true. She meets Arthur, marries him and later has a love affair with Lancelot, someth based on the original tale. But the novel has so much more than that. You will see how this story of magic, prophecies, love and betrayal transpires in an altered, detailed and beautiful light. There are many twists throughout the novel.<br /><br />Guenevere is developed in such an abundant, three-dimensional way in this novel. She is no longer just the pagan beauty who marries a Christian, betrays him and destroys all of Camelot as a result. She is a complex character with flaws as well as virtues in this offering. Arthur is also written in a more interesting, compell way here, but it is Lancelot that once again blows me away. I have always romanticized Sir Lancelot and McKenzie does not disappoint me in her version of the loyal, chivalrous knight. Merlin and Morgan Le Fay are written with much complexity and nuance as well. This novel, however, does not focus so much on the love triangle between Guenevere, Arthur and Lancelot as much as her inability to supply an heir for Arthur and her affection for Arthur's bastard son, the traitorous Mordred. The overall story is magnificent. Once again, I say that McKenzie did a wonderful job bring Guenevere to life. She turns this character into a strong, intelligent, complex, three-dimensional, flesh and blood woman, someone you will feel a great deal of affinity with. She is not portrayed as a simple-minded, traitorous hussy in this one! I loved the fanciful storytell style that made me turn the pages until the wee hours of the night. Some of my friends who read the book along with me complained about it be too long-winded. I didn't think it was long-winded at all. In fact, I wish it had been longer. I loved this book and I look forward to giv Grail Prince a whirl.for Arthur and her affection for Arthur's bastard son, the traitorous Mordred. The overall story is magnificent.

Concise and clear,I picked up this book on a remainder table.  I had heard of Eudora Welty, only because of this book, which won her the Pulitzer Prize. <br /> <br />I was not dissapointed for the follow reasons: <br />1. The book is concise.  Sometimes it is nice to get through a book in 3 hours rather than 3 weeks, or like some that really drag, 3 months.   <br />2. The prose is wonderful, the descriptions colorful.  The storyline is simple, I could summarize the storyline in 3 sentences or less, but what was remarkable was the beauty of the writ and the short, descriptive paragraphs which made me go back and reread a few which I thought were particularly poignant. <br />3. The storyline, although simple, is interesting. I could relate to Laurel; I could see the old house and recognize all the neighbors as they came to her father's wake.  I am surprised it has not been made into a movie. (or has it?)  <br />4. The storyline and writ style reminded me of 'A Summons to Memphis\\" by Peter Taylor, another Southern writer. <br /> <br />If you are look for action packed, this book isn't it.  Should you want to appreciate some of the finest American Literature of the 20th century, this is a good pick.   <br />
The artifacts of the great civilizations of Mesoamerica and the Andes,My assumption is that a DK Eyewitness Book entitled \\"Aztec, Inca & Maya\\" would devote sections to each of the three great civilizations that Spanish explorers encountered and eradicated in the 16th century.  The Aztec empire stretched between the Pacific and the Atlantic costs of Mesoamerica, the Maya kingdom was found in the eastern part of Mesoamerica, and the Inca Empire stretched 4,000 miles along the western coast of South America.  But this book considers the people of these regions to be a mosaic of tribes and nations so that most of the chapters are topical, talk about food and drink, religious life, masks, and such in terms of all of the cultures that apply.  There are a few specific chapters devoted to the Incas and their ancestors and Cities of the Andes, but most toss in everyth together.<br /><br />I have to admit, I do not find this approach to work anymore than one about Mediterranean cultures that lumps Spain, Italy and Greece together with the likes of Portugal, Sicily, and Crete thrown in for good measure.  In this volume the Olmecs, Teotihuacans, and Toltecs are thrown in for good measure, but not so that you can have anyth close to a clear conception of the specific cultures.  There are some topics where it makes sense to talk about multiple cultures, such as the Human sacrifice by the Incas and Aztecs, but that does not apply to all of these topics.  Consequently, I am tempted to get different colored highlighters and color code the three main cultures throughout the book so it is easier to make the connections.<br /><br />As always, the chief attraction of this Eyewitness Book is that it is filled with photographs of artifacts from museums around the world, from the Archaeological Museum in Lima the National Palace in Mexico City to the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Florence and the Rietberg Museum in Zurich (a subtle reminder that a lot of New World treasures made their way to Europe).  Most of us will never get to see a Toltec coyote warrior inlaid with mother-of-pearl, the Gateway of the Sun at Tiahuanaco, or a \\"teponaztli\\" (horizontal drum) in person.  \\"The Los Angeles Times Book Review\\" called one of these volumes \\"Like a mini-museum between the covers of a book,\\" which is so on point that DK always puts that quote on the back.  Almost as important, Elizabeth Bauedano provides detailed captions for the illustrations so that you know what you are look at and what it means.  Consequently \\"Aztec, Inca & Maya\\" works better as a supplemental source than as an introduction to these fascinat civilizations.nlaid with mother-of-pearl, the Gateway of the Sun at Tiahuanaco, or a \\"teponaztli\\" (horizontal drum) in person.  \\"The Los Angeles Times Book Review\\" called one of these volumes \\"Like a mini-museum between the covers of a book,\\" which is so on point that DK always puts that quote on the back.

I'm obsessed......,I'm obsessed with this book.  I had to have it when I first saw it in Border's bookstore. I ran out to Michael's Craft store that night and loaded up on Wilton \\"candy melts\\".  The decorated cakes in this book are fabulous.  They are not your ordinary buttercream rose cakes that are a single uniform color.  They are not formal fondant covered structures. They are...well..whimsical - that is the perfect word for these cakes.  They are bright and fun and bold and artistic, delicious and just plain amazing.  But I must admit, the melted chocolate decorations are not as easy as they appear in the book's instructions.  I'm not at all a beginner baker but this is the first time I've made \\"art\\" with melted chocolate and mine did not look so good. I've only tried it twice though and I am go to keep trying. Hopefully I will improve. The chocolate designs in this book are the dream results I strive for.  I've sat and read this book cover to cover about 4 times now.  I'm obsessed! The tiered cakes that she designs can have 2 or 3 completely different patterns or colors in the same cake. Sometimes each tier has a different pattern and color on each side. The colors are deep and are not commonly seen on cakes but on her cakes they look appropriate. Usually a cake decorat book concentrates on just the actual decorat part and the recipes are not that important to the author.  Not with this book. These recipes are excellent and easy.  Pretty basic flavors and instructions and very very good. I can't wait for the Christmas season when I can attempt to make that cute light blue snowman cake. The decorated cakes shown in this book would be fun to design but they just put ideas in your head for your own creations and you can just go wild with the possibilities!  I highly recommend this book!
OK but not as good as the Illuminator,The most interest part of the book (which I really WANTED to love) was the politics of artistry among the artists, their staff, the church and the nobles.   The love story is less interesting.  Raphael, never before in love, falls for Margherita, a baker's daughter on sight - drawn by her spirit and independence.  Onoce they become involved though, the most she does is hang out in places/with things he buys her, mak love to him and swoon \\"Amore Mio, Rafaello\\" and becomes much less interesting, so you wonder what the heck is this love story of the century really all about? <br /> <br />Read the Illuminator instead - much more interest from start to finish
Cut yourself and then put a band-aid on...,The book is a good start point for you (and loved ones) if you're unfamiliar with liv an organic/natural/active/non-toxic lifestyle. It can be the start of a healthy journey for the rest of your and your family's life - and even SAVE your lives. You'll get start advice on design and liv a life that minimizes (and likely prevents) the onset of most illnesses that seemingly require only pharmaceuticals - pill popp is NOT the only solution. Isn't that the cure of all cures - prevention and healthy maintenance? Of course, there's a place for wonderful antidotes and medical breakthroughs like penicillin, but not ALL pharmaceuticals like Vioxx are as safe as they may sound. Those are just \\"bandages\\" that don't address the source, which can include the foods you eat, the quality of the environment you surround yourself with, your physical activity, etc. <br /> <br />Even if you already have an illness, some simple lifestyle changes may be all it takes to reverse the condition. He mentions a lot of tips, some you've heard, some you haven't. One is eat the organic equivalents of the current foods you eat. Yes, organic food is a little more expensive, but how expensive is a trip to the hospital, or a visit to the doctor or lost wages due to be sick and not able to go to work. When you do the math, organic food isn't that expensive and well-worth buying. You may look into read a book called, \\"The Taste That Kills\\". And think of regular cow's milk: it's been pumped with hormones and have grazed in pastures treated with artificial herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides. I now drink organic milk (and may switch to soy or almond milk). And artificial sugars.. my co-worker and her husband have stopped drink diet soda and her migraines and his lethargy are gone. <br /> <br />After mak some changes, I've stopped tak Aciphex! If you don't know, it's a drug for acid reflux. It's meant to be taken once daily, ideally for the rest of your life! I have taken it for 3 years DAILY. The independence is PRICELESS. <br /> <br />I have much more energy, more vibrancy and vitality, my skin is youthful since mak the simple changes mentioned in the book and from my own research on the net and in books. I don't do everyth he suggests - I just took what's useful. It wasn't easy as some things had an \\"addictive\\" pull that I had to persist through - but it's worth it. Plus, I was annoyed at first because this isn't exactly cheap to do. I made some sacrifices; I managed my spend better. This small cost of treat your body/mind like gold outweighs the cost of gett sick and feel much less than ecstatic. <br /> <br />In addition, you'll get his interest viewpoint of the motivations of the pharma's, FDA et al. I believe that justifies check this book out... to form your own opinion, dissent or otherwise. What if... he's not mak any of this up? He does sound a bit fanatical about it but it has prompted me to be aware of the possibility of the FDA, politicians, and pharmaceuticals silently help each other, for example: \\"On February 10, 1993, Sen. Chafee and his wife purchased between 2,000 and 30,000 dollars worth of stock in Merck (the giant pharmaceutical... specializ in human AND animal drugs). It just so happens that this purchase coincides with the introduction of at least five major health-care bills. And since Sen. Chafee sits on the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Health as well as the Subcommittee on Medicare, his purchase of Merck constitutes an immediate and glar conflict of interest (motherjones).\\" <br /> <br />I think the main value of this book is that it will help people to wake up and take charge of their health - that's a good thing! Research the things he mentions that resonate with you. Add some regular exercise and healthy foods AND eliminate fast food, all soda, refined sugars, TV/microwave dinners, 10-minute oven pizzas, artificially sweetened ANYTHING, hormone milk, potatochips, cheap bread, anyth fried. If you can honestly say your life won't be better do that, then take those prescribed drugs to alleviate the conditions that are caused by those foods. That's like purposely cutt yourself and putt a band-aid on. You have more control over your health than you realize. Again, compare the cost of chang some of your habits to how expensive a trip to the hospital is, or a visit to the doctor or lost wages due to be sick and not able to go to work. <br /> <br />It's not a perfect how-to book, but it's a start, and a start is all you need. What's nice about this book is that you get both a beginner's guide to conscious health and a controversial report about the FDA, pharmaceuticals, et al. The latter has had a big influence on me, to the point where I'm go to volunteer some time to 1) educat instead of EXCLUSIVELY medicat 2) help (somehow and however small) to check and balance the powers-that-be involved with the big pharmaceuticals. <br /> <br />If you get this book (or similar), may it start you on a healthier and happier, stress-free life.
If your child likes broccoli, don't buy this book,because he/she probably won't eat broccoli after read it.  It might be a silly reason to give a bad rat to a book, but when your child loves broccoli, reads a book that says broccoli is poisoned and should be avoided, and from that point on refuses to eat it, you don't like the book. <br /> <br />I wish authors would think about this kind of thing.
Tak JavaScript Seriously,Ajax is an unusual beast. It's not a product. It's not a standard. It's not a tool. It's not proprietary. And it's not a proper noun -- it's an acronym (although it's usually spelled as if it were a proper noun).  Instead, Ajax is a collection of techniques for build highly interactive Web based applications us industrial-strength JavaScript and asynchronous communications, and it's tak the Web development world by storm. This is one of the first books to appear on this very hot topic, and I have to say it's a very good one. <br /> <br />\\"Foundations of Ajax\\" takes you through the whys and wherefores of Ajax, as well as the meat and potatoes, at a brisk pace. The examples are crystal clear. One difficulty in describ Ajax applications is that they're inherently multi-language -- part is always JavaScript, and the rest is always written in a server-side language of your choice. Choos a particular server language might have alienated some readers unfamiliar with it. This book neatly sidesteps the problem by us fixed XML files for the server component for most examples, which leads to startlingly simple descriptions. <br /> <br />As someone who has already learned the basics of Ajax, however, I found the second half of the book even more valuable. The last few chapters talk about tools and techniques for build real-life professional-grade applications. There is excellent, detailed information about documenting, unit test and debugg for JavaScript, debugg Ajax communications, and us some of the newfangled Ajax frameworks that have begun to appear. These chapters credibly demonstrate that it's possible to treat JavaScript as a Serious Programm Language. <br /> <br />In sum, I think that \\"Foundations of Ajax\\" is an excellent piece of work which belongs on every Web developer's bookshelf.
Wake-up Call,If I didn't know better, I would think that the authors of this book had hidden cameras in my pantry (and in my subconscious).  In just the first few pages, they perfectly described my over-eat episodes as if they'd been there with me while I devoured an entire bag of chocolate chips.  And in the subsequent chapters they revealed the lies I've been tell myself in the back of my mind, help me get honest with myself about my distorted view of my body, my eating, and how to find happiness.  Although the book is clearly aimed at women in their mid-life (one of the 8 points in the plan is specific to menepause), I found most of the book applicable to me as a 30yo man who has fluctuated between over-eat and restrict my whole life.  I feel like, for the first time in my life, a veil has been lifted that has revealed all the ridiculous lies I've been tell myself that keep me unhappy.  I'm just start out, try to regain my ability to know when I'm really hungry (not tired, angry, bored, or depressed), and when I'm full (rather than eat until I'm sick).  I already find I'm eat more than I convinced myself I should eat (though surely less than I was eating, since I'm not gorg on cookies anymore).  I also have more energy and find myself able to deal with work and home with a smile, rather than succumb to tension.  If you've ever told yourself that your happiness is dependant on los a few more pounds, or you've ever started eat a cake by tak a small slice, then rationalized another small slice, then another, and another and another, until the cake is nearly gone -- this book will be a kind, gentle wake-up call and help you take rational steps toward a healthy relationship with food.
Wants to be useful. But just isn't.,I thought of several different ways in which to begin this review - several witty comparisons that would surely catch the reader's attention. But that was a month and a half ago. See, I started read Blue Like Jazz on the 20th of July and it is now the 4th of October. I have four pages left and I'm not sure I have the strength to continue.    For you see: Donald Miller is wearying. Endlessly self-amused and self-absorbed, he seems to want noth so much as to be hip, cool, edgy (despite his own protests that hip, edgy, and cool are vanities and wastes of time and energy). And if four years of highschool taught me anything, it is that everyone with a heart is thoroughly and deeply embarrassed when the Very Not Cool Guy walks in and tries to be cool. Think: The Offspring's \\"Pretty Fly for a White Guy.\\"    The th is: Christianity cannot be cool. There is no reason non-believers should see Christianity as anyth even on the same plane as Cool. Christianity says and believes terrify things about the non-believer. Forget the homosexuals a minute - Christianity says that the friendly, tax-paying, socially-active, community-lead paragon of virtue who doesn't bow the knee to Christ is horribly wicked and an actual enemy of God. No matter how kind and cool they are. For Christianity to become cool, it has to stop hav anyth to do with Christ and his message. Maybe Donald Miller wants that. It kinda seems like it, but who can say - since he's not that great at express anyth beyond his own meander and fleet feelings on matters.    About two-thirds into the book, a friend (who won't receive an identity via nickname, such as Tony the Beat Poet or Andrew the Protester) asked me what kind of a book it was. I had a hard time describ it at first. Then I realized: \\"OMG!! I'm read a blog on paper! LOL!!\\" Really, Miller's book is noth more than a glorified blog in its meander promise to get to a point that never comes. In reality, Miller wouldmake a much better blogger than he does a writer. Unfortunately, even as a blogger, he would only be so good - because despite moments of value and bits that come close to insight, his style is heavy-handed and obvious for too much of the book's 240 pages (I know, only 240 pages and it's taken me almost two-and-a-half months!).     One good-but-obvious point Miller makes throughout the book is that the human expression of Christianity in the contemporary American church is lack at best, gravely flawed at worst, but most likely, somewhere in between. This is clearly true. But also clearly known to probably most of us. And the real problems are not often the ones that Miller is point out - he seems frequently upset at how little the church fits in with a world filled with lovely sinners. Yet still, there is value in his critique.    But not much. Again Miller shows himself to be like too many bloggers; and like too many bloggers, he has much criticism and too few answers. If he were a blogger, this might be acceptable; after all, the only cost associated with read a blog is time (and perhaps mental health). A book, however, is paid in currency. There is real loss if a book does not measure up to its published value - and Blue Like Jazz does not. I hate to say that because there are a few amus stories and I get the feel the book wants to be useful - but it just isn't.
More facts and less name-calling, please,Since you're read this, I assume you're think of buy  or at least read  this book.  That be so, you'll probably want to read other reviews than mine.  This is in principle a good idea; but hav just read all of them (147 at the time of writing) I should warn you that you'll need both considerable stamina and a strong stomach: there are indeed thoughtful and informative reviews, but they are islands in a sea of drivel.  By &#34;drivel&#34; I mean the following:<br /><br />1) Reviews consist entirely (or almost entirely) of expostulation rather than information (&#34;racist garbage&#34;, &#34;most important book of the 20th century&#34;)<br /><br />2) Assert what the book doesn't deny and deny what it doesn't assert.<br /><br />3) Distortions of the book's content, and other disinformation, for instance:<br /><br />  - &#34;the panel criticized the authors for not explain what intelligence is&#34; (intelligence is defined on page 4 (!) ).<br /><br />  - &#34;The Bell Curve ignores bad diet&#34; (Nutrition is explicitly dealt with on pp. 391-3).<br /><br />And so on.<br /><br />Many of the critics appear not merely to have misunderstood the book, but not even to have read it; amusingly, this is actually admitted in one review (&#34;Although Head has only browsed through the book, she has seen this kind of pseudo-science before&#34;).  Some appear to be bas their argument upon the Moralistic Fallacy: if different groups had different average IQs for even partially genetic reasons, it would be a Bad Thing, and therefore that cannot possibly be the case.<br /><br />(It also follows, naturally, that there's no need to examine the evidence, because the correct outcome is known in advance; and also that those who think otherwise must be mak factual and/or logical errors, either unconsciously or consciously, mak them fools in the former case and fascists in the latter.)<br /><br />For myself, I found this a strange book in some ways, but only one other reviewer (Jennifer Kerns, I think the name was) touched on the reason.  And that is that the book falls logically into three parts, which by their very nature are of vary reliability.<br /><br />The first, and by far the largest, covers the available evidence on IQ and heredity.  The second and third parts extrapolate present trends to the future (with unpleasant consequences) and make policy recommendations to deal with these projected consequences.  Thus almost by definition these are on shakier ground.<br /><br />- The first section, which excited by far the most controversy, is (ironically), easily on the firmest ground scientifically  as confirmed (for example) by an American Psychological Association task force explicitly set up to investigate it*; and by a letter to the Wall Street Journal by fifty-two lead psychometricians, a copy of which can be found on the Net (&#34;Mainstream Science on Intelligence&#34;, also reprinted as an appendix in H.J. Eysenck's [[ASIN:156000360X Intelligence: A New Look]]).<br /><br />It seems to me a very able summary: it defines its terms, states its assumptions, produces its evidence and argues the merits of the various theories purport to explain it.  So there's no need for you to take my word (or anyone's) as to whether the thesis is justified; the evidence and the arguments are both there; if you're capable of rational thought, you should be able to decide for yourself.  And this is what I advise you to do.<br /><br />- The second part envisages the potential stratification of society by intelligence into a hereditary &eacute;lite and underclass.  Here the authors start to part company with some (at least) of the aforementioned psychometricians.  Eysenck, for instance  certainly in the &#34;hereditarian&#34; camp as regards IQ  writes of an earlier article in Atlantic Monthly:<br /><br />&#34;Here Herrnstein is definitely beginn to run off the rails in his predictions (...) he disregards the importance of regression, the genetic factor which causes children of very bright and very dull parents to regress towards the mean of the whole population (...) [R]egression makes it quite impossible that castes should be created which will breed true  that is, where the children will have the same IQ as their parents.  Within a few generations, the differences in IQ between the children of very bright and very dull parents will have been completely wiped out.&#34; ([[ASIN:091273616X The Inequality of Man]], pp.213-219)<br /><br />Richard Lynn, however, disagrees, point out that if regression operated in all cases, then dog-breeding, and indeed evolution as a whole, would be impossible.<br /><br />- The third part, the policy recommendations, is well outside my area of competence, so I offer no comment.<br /><br />I should, however, like to make one further comment on other reviews, those contain the recommendation: &#34;People want an honest scientific analysis of the claims of racial superiority should read Stephen Jay Gould's [[ASIN:0393314251 The Mismeasure of Man]]&#34;.<br /><br />Gould's writ certainly has many admirable qualities, but honesty and scientific impartiality are not conspicuous among them  for specifics, see (for example)  Chapter 3 of John L. Casti's [[ASIN:0380711656 Paradigms Lost]]. Or see J. Philippe Rushton's review of &#34;Mismeasure&#34;, or Arthur Jensen's review (&#34;The Debunk of Scientific Fossils and Straw Persons&#34;), or John B. Carroll's, all of which you can find on the Web.<br /><br />I've been follow the debate over IQ for 40 years, and [[ASIN:0393314251 The Mismeasure of Man]] has more factual errors per page than any book I've ever read.<br /><br />For a critical but still rational review of Herrnstein & Murray, I suggest Thomas Sowell's from American Spectator, which can also be found on the Web (&#34;Ethnicity and IQ&#34;).<br /><br />If you want a balanced account of the IQ field, try [[ASIN:0330263994 Intelligence: The Battle for the Mind]], half of which is written by H.J.

Exhaustive, but a few issues,Absolutely, as other reviewers have noted, this is a book more geared toward very serious home cooks and even professional chefs.  It contains entries on foodstuffs very rarely seen on modern tables, like chilled meat jellies. <br /> <br />I find the occasional technique too vague or minimally described. I also find Peterson's tone rather arrogant at times, like when he talks about the \\"right\\" consistency for some sauces that may be properly made in more than one style. <br /> <br />I also think he occasionally underseasons and undersalts, and blindly repeats some mantras that simply aren't true.  He says at one point that unsalted butter is often fresher than salted.  I know that's just a \\"fact\\" that goes without say to a lot of cooks, but as anyone who's ever worked in a market can tell you, it's ludicrous.  If anything, salted butter is more likely to be fresh because it sells so much quicker than unsalted.  A quick perusal of expiration dates in your grocer's case will verify this.  (It's especially true with European-style butters in specialty shops, even in busy stores.)  And again, I think he undersalts frequently anyhow. <br /> <br />Not a book for the casual cook, and I wouldn't buy it for the main-dish recipes.  This is where you go to learn the classic techniques (most of which you won't use more than a few times a year).  Can be a fun read as much as anyth else.
Read this book to understand how far we have descended,In the middle of the 2004 presidential election campaign a report released by the Union of Concerned Scientists, endorsed by thousands of respected academics, accused the Bush administration of an unprecedented pattern of distortion and censorship of important scientific evidence. In typical fashion, the administration responded only when the UCS report gained media attention, and then only to dismiss it as a partisan attack from the left. <br /> <br />Chris Mooney's book documents in plain and incontrovertible fashion why the UCS report was not only non-partisan truth, but significantly understated the case. The current political abuse of science is only the culmination of a consistent strategy fostered by a \\"hard right\\" alliance of corporate and religious conservatives that has gained control of the Republican party since the 1960's. <br /> <br />Corporate attacks on science started with tobacco industry efforts to undermine studies on the health effects of smok and second-hand smoke. The pattern laid down by the tobacco industry has been consistently followed since: the terms \\"sound science\\" and \\"junk science\\", meaningless in any scientific sense, originated with tobacco lawsuits and have been parlayed by conservatives into codewords for science that respectively supports or threatens \\"conservative\\" ideology. <br /> <br />Mooney categorizes the attacks on science as fall into two main categories. The first of these is an undermin of the processes of science by suppression of information, target individual scientists (many of whom work for the government or rely on government grants), or rigg review and advisory committees. The second form these right-w attacks take is through the communication process to the public after reports are released. This includes \\"spinning\\" the science through misrepresentations or distortions, magnify uncertainty, rely on and promot fringe scientists and \\"contrarians\\", and putt scientific cloth on \\"values\\" and ideology. <br /> <br />\\"Manufactur uncertainty\\" was a key to the tobacco industry strategy that has been repeated again and again on issues from global warm to evolution.  Find a token scientist to magnify \\"contrarian\\" claims isn't hard: science's health comes from the weather of constant attacks by those who choose to think differently. But sadly there are also too many scientists will to distort their own research to conform to the ideologies of fund sources, and a disturb number of government scientists work for regulatory agencies have been encouraged to alter conclusions of their reports. Mooney notes the sharp distinction in conclusions on the effects of second-hand smoke between industry-funded and independent scientists. <br /> <br />It is one th to argue and make political decisions based on all the best facts available. That's what we expect our leaders to do. But the right w attack on science is not satisifed with the facts as they are on the environemnt, biology or medicine. Rather they seek to distort those facts, impos ideology at an earlier stage, so that decision makers and the public don't even have the truth available to them to make good decisions. <br /> <br />Many of the \\"contrarian\\" scientists who have been selected by the Bush administration to sit on major oversight and advisory panels have very little research background at all. Unfortunately, science's ivory tower makes it far too easy to \\"play scientist\\" for the public - there are no external credential mechanisms that effectively separate real experts from impostors. Tellingly, for these political hacks the arguments change with time as the facts on the ground become increasingly inconvenient to their ideology. Denial of global warm becomes denial of human causation, now morph into assertion that global warm will be good for us. Creationism becomes \\"intelligent design\\". <br /> <br />The broad range of regulatory and scientific areas where the same anti-science tactics have been used forces the conclusion that this is more than separate isolated incidents. Similar issues with failed intelligence on 9-11 and Iraq's WMD, and other apparent efforts to conceal the facts on the ground by the administration imply this pattern of ideological decision mak extends far beyond  the areas where science is the central source of facts. <br /> <br />There are examples of liberal science abuse too, where individuals are tempted to spin the facts to fit their ideology. Mooney cites a few cases, but the only systematic pattern seems to be one of exaggeration of direct effects and perhaps denial of uncertainty. Of the examples in question, almost all show liberal statements to be much closer to the scientific facts than the right-w spin on the same issues. Even so, neither side should try to twist science to their benefit, and to his credit Mooney does criticize both. <br /> <br />The book has a few flaws: there are occasional jarr repetitions of previous arguments that suggest chapters were rewritten several times in mid-stream, without reconsider the book as a whole. Mooney also seems reluctant to state as baldly as possible what's go on here: some people are ly about the facts, and as a result, other people are dy needlessly. Isn't there legal recourse for such fraud, as happened in the case of tobacco? <br /> <br />Mooney makes a number of sensible suggestions beyond legal action: reinstate the congressional Office of Technology Assessment, pass legislation to bar political litmus tests for committees, roll back the \\"sound science\\" regulatory reform that has done so much harm. More skepticism and understand of the processes of science from journalists would be a big help, as would some reforms in the science community itself.  But as he also points out, significant change will be impossible in our democracy as long as the current ideologues hold all the strings of power. Gett the information out somehow and persuad the public to vote for moderates instead of ideologues is the most important th we can do - will it be enough?
Room to disagree, but unforgettable,* Joel Rosenberg is a fiction writer in the footsteps of Clive Cusler, Allistair McClean, and Tom Clancy.  He lacks the refinement that McClean and Clancy achieved, but not the excitement or the believability.  With the added attraction of Bible based futurism, this book is not only very readable, but also a bellwether of modern reality fiction.  You may disagree with the fundamental premise of this book, but you will not regret read it.   <br />* This is a bold book, launch into verboten format, subject matter, and choice of protagonists.  Four pages of introduction by the publisher before the title page, plotted on an Old Testament prophecy, and introduc Messianic Jews into the Israeli government, the author and the publisher risked accusations of right w extremism and political incorrectness ... and have silenced their critics. <br />* World War III is coming, and the end result is almost certain devastation.  Not only has the old soviet Russia risen from the cloak of its own ashes, but it has emasculated its prime enemies by brilliant and cunn propaganda and usage of subterfuge, misdirection, and infiltration.  The U.S. president is backed into a corner with his hands tied, most of America's allies have been blackmailed into throw aside their cloaks of friendship and forgett the lessons of World War II.  The Jews are abandoned to a new holocaust, and Israel faces its darkest days since Nebuchadnezzar's forces carried Jerusalem away to Babylon.   <br />* But the Senior Advisor to the President, Jon Bennett, is busy on a peace mission to Moscow.  Accompanied by his long time associate and perennial date, Erin McCoy, he is unprepared for the literal firestorm which sweeps him into the picture.  If there is to be a peaceful solution to this dilemma, he is the world's last chance.  But HE FAILS. <br />* What follows is a race against time and evil.  A believable love story is the motivation for Bennett's personal involvement while his professional involvement is motivated by the very existence of life and freedom.  There seems to be no solution for either problem.  With a sensitive but uncensored presentation of his turmoil, the reader is drawn into his fight by a gripp adventure that makes U.S. President MacPherson, Israeli Prime Minister Doron, former head of Mossad Dr. Mordechai, and the new Russian Czar to be the support cast in a drama of the world gone berserk. <br />* This book is also to be commended for what it doesn't have, filthy language, bedroom scenes, and glorification of that which is evil.  It proves that a book can be sold, even if it doesn't cater to the prurient interests of a degenerate audience. <br />* That said, there are legitimate criticisms of this book.  First, by chos a modern translation of the Bible, the author has lost much of the authority of the prophecy that would have been present had he chosen to quote the time honored K James Bible.  Second, while otherwise remain faithful to Biblical teaching, he strays into angelic appearances to preach the Gospel, and third, most pre-millennial prophetic scholars would agree that Mr. Rosenberg has misplaced the tim of his prophecy.  A fourth point is the most dissappoint ommission of the role of the Roman Catholic Church.  Where the Bible points the finger of God's wrath at the city that sits on seven hills, the author redirects this attention to an as yet unbuilt Iraqi Babylon.  Nevertheless, the impact of the fulfilment of Biblical prophecy can not be overestimated. <br />
from a lexicographer,I'm a lexicographer and computational linguist by profession -- I have very nearly read this book (and a couple others) cover to cover. I just have to say that AH is a superior dictionary for everyday use.     I work for companies that maintain online dictionaries, and am, among other things responsible for compar the contents of these lists with the latest published dictionaries to ascertain which entries should be deleted and which new ones included. I find that AH very rarely has bad judgement with respect to selection of entries.     Perhaps the reason another reviewer didn't find Carl Gauss or Reimann is because their names are actually Karl Gauss and Riemann. And I appreciate the fact that AH has gone a long way toward rectify the perception conveyed by most older biographical dictionaries that all great people have been white, European and male. We need Gauss in there of couse, but we also need Robeson and St. Vincent Millay who won a Pulitzer Prize just like Frost, and who wrote just as beautifully.     Its goal obviously is to both be a desktop dictionary in a single volume, and yet include the words that educated American speakers are likely to encounter in modern, non-technical publications. (And yes, it is an American dictionary, which is why colour is defined as 'Chiefly British, variant of color'.) This objective becomes harder and harder to achieve as the base of English-speak people expands, and the Internet makes so many more things available to the average reader. The average person may use words like 'alacrity' less often than they did 200 years ago, but in point of fact, the average person's active vocabulary is expanding.     I prefer the way they organize their word senses to what Webster does. (I never compare things to the OED, because that is a work of art, deserv of veneration.) It reserves entirely new entries for an entirely unrelated sense. AH will give iris(flower) and iris(of the eye) two different senses, but Webster's gives (though not entirely consistently) the nominal and verbal senses of, say, 'claim' entirely different entries. AH includes them under the same entry, because they are semantically very closely related.     The etymological Appendix of AH is also kind of famous among linguists. They have very nicely systematized and cross-referenced their entries against their hypothesized Indo-European roots. It's quite well researched, and also a lot of fun.
Dover Edition is not Unabridged, as marked on cover,I have two copies of this wonderful book in front of me...the Dover Juvenile Classics edition and the beautiful hardcover by Macmillan.  Not only does the Dover edition omit all the sweet pictures, but right from the very first page it omits a sweet exchange between \\"Mr. Author\\" and an unnamed interlocutor--reminiscent of the story interruptions by the \\"real\\" Christopher Robin and the narrator of the Pooh stories.  If someth has obviously been cut out right from the first page, I'd bet other passages have been cut out, too.  Perhaps this is unabridged from some version of the story, but it is definitely not the most complete text available.  Stick to the hardcover or deluxe versions of the text for the real thing.
Comprehensive visual reference guide but incomplete.,At last... a comprehensive visual compendium of the most celebrated artistic promotional film market campaign worldwide... almost.  You would think that the opulent Mr. Sansweet would have in his possession every single poster to have ever rolled off the print press for this unprecedented franchise but several of my favorite foreign one-sheets, daybills, banners and bus stop posters are notably missing.  Does this mean that Mr. Sansweet has not aquired all of them in his envious collection of Star Wars memorabilia?  Not likely.  Chances are he has every single one of them... locked away somewhere within the bowels of his coveted archives.  Most notably absent is the lack of reference material specifically promot Revenge of the Sith and would seem to indicate that this book was completed and ready to be published just prior to the film's theatrical exhibition, but there is a plethora of wonderful international promotional material such as the six character U.K. bus stop posters that are much more visually excit than the disappoint U.S. domestic ad campaign that demands to be published.  This can only mean that another volume must be sure to follow.  Still, there are enough international poster variations out there to keep collectors like myself and presumably Mr. Sansweet himself scour the farthest reaches of the globe and the galaxy for years to come.
Easy and Exciting,The book, and most especially the DVD, teach a beautiful, fast, fun, and easy technique for machine quilting.  I personally have never liked stippl as a background qult design and so was very excited when I first saw a friend do \\"McTavishing\\".  In addition to the \\"McTavishing\\" design, Karen demonstrates about 6 other patterns includ an amazingly graceful and fairly simple Victorian Feather. The book and DVD give you all the information you need to sit down and practice this technique and very quickly master it.  I highly recommend it.
An amaz sequel!,If you were stunned by \\"Gridlinked,\\" and left awe-struck by \\"The Line of Polity,\\" then I guarantee you won't be disappointed with \\"Brass Man.\\" Pick up almost immediately after the end of Line, it continues the saga of ECS agent Ian Cormac, and weaves narratives for many characters introduced in the previous two novels - plus several fascinat new ones - into an extremely satisfy whole. Best of all, it brings back one of the most unique and enigmatic of all of Asher's creations - the flawed yet noble Golem Twenty-Five, Mr. Crane.
A well-researched and good book,The author was born in Vienna but left when he was 11.  After the war he returned, to get his university education, and served as a correspondent for United press, ABC, and Newsweek.  This is an account of the occupation of Austria by Hitler, and what Vienna went through while part of Nazidom.  The account of the takeover by Hitler is of high interest and well-told.  The account of the war years is also well done but it was not as interesting.  In the final chapter Weyl gives a good account of Austria since the war, and shows that many Austrians exaggerate their resistance to Hitler. This is a book well worth read if you want to know about Austria's fall and the dreary war years in Vienna, and the post-war course of Austria.  One is glad that so much that was destroyed in the war has been reconstituted.
A Thoughtful and Enjoyable Look Backstage at the Opera,For the operaholics among us (I am one) \\"Fortissimo\\" is an entertain and interest look at what goes on backstage at the opera. Author Murray was given unprecedented access to Lyric Opera of Chicago's Opera Center for American Artists dur the 2003-2004 season. This is Lyric Opera's train ground for young artists. Murray follows this group of twelve singers through coach sessions, rehearsals, auditions and performances to give the reader a close-hand look at the rigorous intensity of this most glorious art form. Interspersed with this are chapthers which fill out the picture of what it takes to succeed in opera. There is a chapter devoted to the comprimario - singers who specialize in secondary characters. Another chapter is devoted to Pavarotti, a warn of what can happen when one achieves what Murray dubs 'sacred monster' status. A sacred monster, superstar, Pavarotti was undone at the end of his career by his enormous ego. This book is a wonderful gift for those opera lovers on your Christmas list this season.
hopeful, but....,Eloquently argued thesis for why peace in the middle east is not only possible, but in the best interest of all the peoples who live there. Unfortunately, I feel that the premises are naive and the entire arguement fails when one considers that Hamas and the other rejectionist groups will never accept Israel's existence, no matter how much Israel is will to compromise. That a huge number of Palestinians (majority?) agree with the \\"terrorists'\\" position and hate Jews and will never accept the concept of giv away any \\"holy\\" Arab land leaves hope for peace quite impotent. The book makes logical sense, but passions do not respond to logic, especially in the middle east.
A Great Example of Human Thought 50 Years Ahead of its Time!,My first reaction to the sight of yet another groundbreaking, landmark book by process theologian David Ray Griffin was one of frank astonishment. I have never seen such overwhelm intellectual power and creativity in the hands of any one individual--ever.<br /><br />Moreover, the quality of his material is typically so far ahead of its time, time and time again, that we should feel fortunate in the extreme to have yet another incredible document \\"from the future\\" here with now, thanks to the truly relentless efforts of David Ray Griffin.
Great book for color knitting, men's knitwear & plus sizes,I just received this book a couple of days ago but I am already enchanted and can't wait to get started on some of the patterns. I have fallen in love with handpainted yarns and this books offers some great ideas for their use. The patterns are great and the photography is wonderful. Best of all it includes many patterns for men in 1x and 2x. Be a guy with a large frame I am continuosly upset with pattern designers who only offer a smatter of male patterns and those are usually for men of slight frame. I also like color in my garments and most male patterns are dark solid colors. This book offers a new look at us colors for any gender. I don't know where one of the previous posters saw all the fair isle. It does include some, but the majority of patterns use color in a variety of other ways. Oh, it also has a lot of great patterns for women.

Click on 'See all my reviews' from these following people, and you'll notice a common aspect: <br /> <br />serene thomas  <br />Ren \\"Ren\\"  <br />I'm sure there are more names, but they advertise the same message on nearly every other health/image book. <br /> <br /> <br />also, isn't it curious that many on the 5-starers have only written one review?? Look at the April 17-20, Jan 25-27 crowd... hmmm a little suspicious... especially since they occur in 2-3 day BLOCKS! <br /> <br />This book should be banned due to the author's wangling! <br /> <br />I'd advise you to read all the 1-star comments.

It's About Time,The Georgia Straight's Lucas Aykroyd reviewed Van Halen 101 in this month's issue. During what was an overall positive review, he managed to write one line that perfectly summed up the book.    \\"This is a book about dudes, by a dude, written for other dudes.\\"    That one line says it all. Lucas got it. Just like the author got it. Mr. Sanchez may be just a \\"fan\\" to some, but this \\"fan\\" managed to do for Van Halen what no one else, be it fan or professional, has ever done for the band in their entire history. It's about time. Mr. Sanchez put together a fun, interesting, accurate book with a beautiful tribute to Eddie Van Halen. And since the band has never written their own story, and at this point likely never will, this will be as good as it gets.    Up until this point, the only written material we'd received from Van Halen \\"fans\\" never made the passing grade. I've been a VH fan since the band debuted and I own everything ever written about them. Back in the nineties there was even some VH fanzine called \\"The Inside.\\" It was by some fan and his buddies. Other than the fact it had really nice pics, it was a typical fanzine written by what appeared to be some college guys with one too many VH posters on their wall. Not exactly a bastion of journalism or something people will seek out years from now. At best, a minor blip on the radar screen.     Then there was the Van Halen Encyclopedia, a collaborative effort by hundreds of fans. It was a fine effort, but this too fell short. It's really just a journal of VH info listed alphabetically. Not the most exciting read. More the cure for insomnia.    Van Halen 101 got it right and goes light years beyond anything that has ever been written on the band. As Lucas said, \\"a book about dudes, by a dude, written for other dudes.\\" This ain't Motley Crue's \\"The Dirt.\\" And really, who would want to waste their money on a bunch of fiction dressed up nicely by Neil Strauss? Unlike \\"The Dirt,\\" Van Halen 101 is legit and positive andfocuses on what is truly important. No time to waste here with \\"inside scoops.\\" Fans who sit around drooling and waiting for that type of stuff need to get a life. Mr. Sanchez shows integrity by not relying on that type of material.     With Van Halen 101, what you see is what you get. No where on this book does the word \\"biography\\" appear. Ever. Not once. It has never been marketed or labeled as such. While it does contain plenty of biographical information on the band, the book is presented as a \\"comprehensive guide to the amazing history, music, impact and influence of the Mighty VH.\\" It says so, clear as day, on the back cover of Van Halen 101. So the author and publisher have never presented this as a \\"biography\\", nor have they ever claimed to have \\"inside scoops\\" or anything of that sort. It's clearly stated the book is a comprehensive guide.    One of the best and easiest ways to determine a book's worth and status is to compare it to other books about the same subject. Just compare Van Halen 101 with the other VH book released in 2005, Backbeat Books \\"Eddie Van Halen: Know the Man, Play the Music.\\" Talk about night and day, Van Halen 101 demolishes that book. Absolutely crushed it. The funny thing is that \\"Eddie Van Halen: Know the Man, Play the Music\\" was written by a \\"professional\\" writer named Malcolm Dome. Yes, Malcolm is a music journalist who also wrote another Van Halen book called \\"Excess in All Areas\\" back in the nineties. By the way, \\"Excess in All Areas\\" is awful, too.    Meanwhile, Van Halen 101 was written and entirely put together by a \\"fan.\\" Well, this \\"fan\\" knows more about VH than a thousand Malcolm Domes, that's for sure.     Van Halen 101 is well worth the money. There is simply nothing out there in book form about Van Halen that comes anywhere close to it. Until the band members get off their duffs and put something together, this is THE Van Halen book.

WARNING!!,Thi book i solely mak it from the false reviews/ advertisment from other books. Click on 'See all my reviews' from these follow people, and you'll notice a common aspect: <br /> <br />serene thoma  <br />Ren \\"Ren\\"  <br />I'm sure there are more names, but they advertise the same message on nearly every other health/image book. <br /> <br /> <br />also, isn't it curiou that many on the 5-starer have only written one review?? Look at the April 17-20, Jan 25-27 crowd... hmmm a little suspicious... especially since they occur in 2-3 day BLOCKS! <br /> <br />Thi book should be bann due to the author' wangling! <br /> <br />I'd advise you to read all the 1-star comments.

With Van Halen 101, what you see i what you get. No where on thi book doe the word \\"biography\\" appear. Ever. Not once. It ha never been market or label a such. While it doe contain plenty of biographical information on the band, the book i present a a \\"comprehensive guide to the amaz history, music, impact and influence of the Mighty VH.\\" It say so, clear a day, on the back cover of Van Halen 101. So the author and publisher have never present thi a a \\"biography\\", nor have they ever claim to have \\"inside scoops\\" or anyth of that sort. It' clearly stat the book i a comprehensive guide.    One of the best and easiest way to determine a book' worth and statu i to compare it to other book about the same subject. Just compare Van Halen 101 with the other VH book releas in 2005, Backbeat Book \\"Eddie Van Halen: Know the Man, Play the Music.\\" Talk about night and day, Van Halen 101 demolishe that book. Absolutely crush it. The funny th i that \\"Eddie Van Halen: Know the Man, Play the Music\\" wa written by a \\"professional\\" writer nam Malcolm Dome. Yes, Malcolm i a music journalist who also wrote another Van Halen book call \\"Exces in All Areas\\" back in the nineties. By the way, \\"Exces in All Areas\\" i awful, too.    Meanwhile, Van Halen 101 wa written and entirely put together by a \\"fan.\\" Well, thi \\"fan\\" know more about VH than a thousand Malcolm Domes, that' for sure.     Van Halen 101 i well worth the money. There i simply noth out there in book form about Van Halen that come anywhere close to it. Until the band member get off their duff and put someth together, thi i THE Van Halen book.
Goodbye, Girls,The Baby-Sitter Club book were the first that I remember reading. When I wa a child, I would take book to the dinner table and read dur a meal (not the best manners, but my parent were ok with it because they encourag me to read whenever I could). I wa crazy about the BSC--I had the videos, dolls, even the sleep bag (which I receiv for my 11th birthday). I can say that I've read up to the point where the acquir Abby a a new sitter, but I spott \\"Graduation Day\\" and had to read it. I feel that I \\"grew up\\" with these girls--even though they are still 13 and I am now 23. The end of a favorite serie i bittersweet. Month ago, \\"pass the torch\\" to my 8 year old niece. On the first day of summer, I mail her a copy of Kristy' Great Idea. She ha fallen in love with the BSC and ha now taken over the collection. When I went back home a few week ago, I had to smile when I saw a copy of \\"Claudia' Goodbye\\" in my old chair at the table.  <br />\\"Graduation Day\\" wa terrific. The perfect end to a wonderful coming-of age series. Goodbye, Girls.
A Splendid Contribution,I have read a number of book on the Civil War in Washington...Fine a those book are, they do not accomplish two thing that are splendid contribution of your book on the weekend home that the Lincoln made of their cottage at the Soldiers' Home. <br /> <br />First, we often forget the huge personal burden that the war place on Lincoln and hi belief, strong in the summer of 1864, that he would be defeat in the next election and that the gain in the war would slip back into Southern control. We can see in your book how hi day and night in the cottage help Lincoln to  hold on to and expand what he had until victory in the 1864 election wa assured. <br /> <br />The other i the lov relationship of the President with hi wife, Mary Lincoln. We often hear of her odditie and runn up of debts. What we do not hear of, and what admirably i stress in your book, i what you describe a \\"the mutual affection and mutual dependence\\" that alway link them despite their great difference in character.  Respect for Mary Lincoln, and her contribution to the greatnes of Abraham Lincoln, i someth we could use more of in writ American history. <br /> <br />I will not go on expect to say that I think I have already indicat the greatnes of your book, and my hope that librarian and reader everywhere will have an opportunity to benefit from it revelation and the new light it bring on the life of one of our very greatest Presidents. <br />
Good Sear primer,If you are new to Dr Sear and sleep i your only issue thi would be a nice choice. I found lot of the sleep idea in The Baby Book which also ha everyth else you ne about rai your baby. The Baby Book would be my first choice from Sears.
Don't waste your time,I have read several book on ADD and found thi book to be full of the same old falacie and myth about Nutrition, medication and biofeedback a all the rest, and none of it works! It wa a waste of my time and money. Don't bother! <br /> <br />The most helpful book that I have read i The ADD & ADHD answer Book by Dr. Susan AShley Ph.D. <br />
got what i paid for, not sure if it work yet.,I got what I paid for but I'm not sure if it work yet.  Thi i one CD and at the beginn of the CD on track 1 it say you should not listen to thi CD unles you have about 1/2 hour of alone time.  It lead you to beleive you ne to listen to a Disc 2 if you want to drive and listen at the same time.  There i no Disc 2, instead you ne to listen to track 6 while driv or anyth like that.  That should be stat on the review, which it' not.  At first I thought I had to buy another CD in order to effectively use this.
Best I have read,I believe it would be fair to say that what a person get out of a book on trad ha a lot to do with their ability to understand and relate to what they read and the degree that the new information gel with what they already consider to be true.  Hav said that, I am glad that I did not allow so-so review of thi book to stop me from purcha it.  My interest i in day trad e-mini futures.  Other book I have read relat to Elliott wave have only provid minimal general guidance.  Thi i the only book on Elliott wave that I have found invaluable.  It took a few reading and some practice but, low and behold, I can now (often) scrutinize a wave and determine if it i an impulse wave or a correction.  The beauty of thi i that it allow you to know if you are still in a correction or if the trend ha resumed.  It allow you to know if there ha been a 5th wave failure or if some form of correction i still developing.  At the end of a 5th wave when the market i spik up and down I can eventually tell if a new thrust in the direction of the trend i part of the trend and possibly the end of the 5th wave or whether it i just a part of a diagonal triangle.  I have a long way to go in master it but I can often see the C wave pattern and appreciate what i go on.  All in all, the market make more sense to me now.  One reviewer comment that do thi would not be possible on intraday charts.  I would have to disagree.  Even small C wave can take 30 minute to hour to develop.  Once the market ha made enough of a move to recognize the correction you would only ne a couple of minute to figure it out even if you consult the book.  So, in short, I am impress and consider thi the best book on trad I have ever read.
Good for only a few people,Most reviewer either gush or bash. Bash wa our first instinct, but that wouldn't be fair or useful. Let me explain... Total Body Makeover i another widely promot health and fitnes book my wife and I had on our list to read thi summer (see all my reviews). The proces we go through i to read it, try out a few of it idea for a while, then read it again. On the first pas we both recoiled. The primary vehicle the author use to communicate with hi reader i to make emotional connections, not by provid actual information. (Much like the BFL for Women book). It relie heavily on third party client storie to get the page count up to sellable form. By the time you get to \\"Renee' Story\\" toward the end, you may either be asleep or tear the page out -- and that would be a shame, a the last 23 page are quite useful. At the end of the book are 10 concise and informative comparative review of the most popular diet programs. You might be able to find the same info on the Internet for free but we've not come acros one before so comprehensive and unbiased. Could be very helpful for someone weigh diet alternative (honest... that wa not an intend pun, it just slipp out :) <br /> <br />Not all reader are the same of course and some people may respond well to the book' Oprah-fluff. If you strip it out you're left with a rather seriou proposition: I your health and fitnes situation dire enough, are you upset enough, are you seriou about it enough, are you committ enough to spend 2 hour every day work out, plu spend the extra time it take to plan, modify, and follow through on a new diet routine?  <br /> <br />The program espos i a wolf in sheep' cloth and the book' title i apt. It really i \\"total body makeover\\" at it core. From our several week trials, very few people are go to be able to follow through with the program on their own for logistical and time management reasons. Those few that do will benefit. Prevent back-slid after the 12 week \\"boot camp\\" i also a very real challenge. The author addresse thi topic, but in our experience all the get-fit-quick program suffer high rate of back-sliding. That thi program' pedegree i celebrity-trainer bas i obviou to us.  <br /> <br />So where doe the book end up in our stack? It' more useful than BFL for Women. Not a helpful to the masse a the original BFL. The only book that stand out from the crowd so far i Avery Hunicutt' Joe X. (We practice the Joe X routine now and so impress with the book we're go to go back and re-review it at some point. We didn't give it near enough credit the first time around. But next up: we'll be review Harley Pasternak' 5-Factor Fitness, another of the heavily promot books.)
An Unexpect Gift to Hawkins' Readers,\\"Truth v Falsehood\\" i Hawkins' 4th book. In my mind, it i hi greatest gift yet, but not in the sense that one might think. Thi will be explain in the closing. I will also preface by say that I am in no way political. Truth i all that I am interest in. <br />   In Hawkins' previou 3 books, the kinesiological response wa portray a infallible. Hi language wa very absolute in it tone, giv the technique more credibility than it ha ever received. Be so absolute with one' tone wa the first obviou clue. When one become absolute in their tone, they often put an inordinate amount of faith in someth outside themselve and overlook the inherent limitations. Thi i true for everyth from religiou absolutism to the mythical cure-all in medicine. The person who use the absolute tone act a if your salvation lie with thi one particular thing.  <br />   I am a traditional naturopath. I wa u kinesiology before Hawkins' books, and I am closely connect to practitioner of kinesiology who've us it in exces of 20 years. An observant and curiou practitioner quickly realize that the intent of both the testee and tester influence response. In some cases, a strong-will practitioner who think he know the cause of imbalance or dis-ease i affect testee response and in essence u kinesiology to validate hi own opinion and beliefs, albeit unknowingly. He will get the positive response he desires, wherea the practitioner with no vest interest in anyth except the truth will get a different response on the same testee.  <br />   It ha been difficult for me to bridge the gap between Hawkins' theory/ doctoral thesi on hi use of kinesiology and the understand that most experienc practitioner of kinesiology have. Nearly all experienc practitioner simply don't find the technique to be infallible. Certain criteria must be met for accurate response. Those criteria are training, impartiality, and the sincere and humble desire to put absolute truth above all things. Truth i absolute, but the technique i not. Remain neutral i an ongo challenge for the practitioner. <br /> <br />   I am not familiar with the test method us for Hawkins' doctoral thesi \\"Quantitative and Qualitative Calibration of the Level of Consciousness\\". However, for it to withstand any scientific scrutiny, both the tester and testee would have to be without any knowledge on the subject matter. There would also have to be at least 20 different tester for the 3000+ test subjects, with each tester com up with their own test response to a given list of questions. Response would not be compar until all tester have compil their findings. For hi thesis, someth along these line wa most likely used.  <br />   Throughout \\"Power vs. Force\\", a healthy skepticism wa maintain toward Hawkin putt so much faith in thi technique. Part of thi wa bas on an inability to get the same response he wa getting. The information present in \\"The Eye of the I\\" and \\"I\\" wa absolutely astounding, and skepticism wa temporarily set aside. Apparently, hi intent wa pure and sincere enough to allow him to experience absolute truth on spiritual inquiry. Much of thi can be attribut to hi description of a life-chang experience. He wa atheist (or possibly agnostic... don't remember which), hit a major crisi in hi life, and finally call out in total humility to be shown the truth of God. I feel hi pure intent allow him to acces the truth he did. <br />   However, once Hawkin gain confidence in the technique, he apparently fell into the trap of think he could divorce himself from influenc response. The method us for glean the information found in \\"Truth v Falsehood\\" would surely not withstand any scientific scrutiny. The simple fact that the subject matter wa familiar to the tester(s) and testee(s) disqualifie it. Ask about the nature of life, death, and other unknown spiritual matter i not the same a ask about one' perceiv reality, which one already ha strong opinion and emotion about and attachment to. Both tester and testee would have to be completely unfamiliar with the line of inquiry to have any guarantee of neutrality. <br /> <br />   Within 30 second of open \\"Truth v Falsehood\\", it wa clear someth wasn't right. Hawkins' 3 previou book have help u to discern truth from falsehood more clearly. Many of u have reach a place where now we `just know' the truth. It i often a clear gut feeling, and at that point the kinesiological response seem unnecessary. In a way, it turn out the technique wa only a tool to guide u to our own inner knowing.  <br />   Hawkin acknowledge the existence of ignorance and untruth, but doe not addres the issue of deliberate deception. It i ironic that after year of devotion to the truth, Hawkin still doe not fully grasp the nature of deception. The world citizenry i currently experienc one of the most elaborate mas brainwashe in history.  <br />   In fact, Hawkin even engage in deception when he explain the Iraq situation. He indicate that the primary reason to be there i to protect the world' (and specifically America's) economic and oil interests. Yet the primary reason given to the public for go to war wa weapon of mas destruction. Whether or not it wa a fact that there were actually WMD misse the point. It wa given a the main reason, and it wa not. That i deception. For Hawkin to agree with the idea of justifiable deception i a clear indicator that he i not neutral here. <br />   More importantly, for Hawkin to act a if outright deception i not occurr speak to one' ability to deal with reality. For a person with 80 year of condition perception of reality to have reality turn on it head, a person could have a seriou breakdown. <br /> <br />   The gift in thi 4th book i that Hawkin ha shown u what thekinesiological technique can and cannot be us for. It can be us by the sincere truthseeker for his/herself. However, it i not to be us to show one a reality they are not ready to see. There i no technique to make one see the truth. One' clear and sincere intention i all that can do that. And even then, one may not be ready to handle the fullnes of reality. The proces of how one \\"wake up\\" i yet to be known. <br />   Who better than Hawkin to show u that experience i no substitute for impartiality? So, the reader of hi 4th book get the opportunity to discern what i truth and what i hi belief. The first 3 book prepar us, and the 4th i the test. Although he didn't intend it to work thi way, it i the greatest gift of all. And just a importantly, it show u that one can be quite enlighten in one area, while not hav it all together in another. Even when one crosse the 600 line, one i still assail by falsity and ignorance and must be constantly vigilant and unattach to one' beliefs.  <br /> <br />   And realistically, it couldn't have happen any other way. Given Hawkins' first 3 book and hi audience, if he gave u the absolute truth about all the deception that make up the current perceiv reality, it could have seriously mess some people up. It could result in seriou mental breakdown if it wa said that there aren't actually arab terrorist creat terror in America. So, the book had to be present thi way. And those of u who know the real truth know it through our own inner know already and don't ne Hawkin to tell us. <br />   In `The Art of War', Sun Tzu said, \\"All warfare i bas on deception.\\" Well, currently we have warfare in nearly every form. Even `necessary' and `justified' war have deception a their roots. <br /> <br />Michael <br />Santa Fe, New Mexico

Let the children play,Thi book will rescue children from boredom and angst, if parent will read it.  It urge familie to lighten up -- to stop excessive worry about traffic, poison ivy, kidnappers, snakes, and broken arm and let children go outside and have fun. It' easy. If you don't live near woods, any small patch of nature will do: Thi writer sing the praise of vacant lots, where beetle live under rock and dandelion tuft wait  to be blown into the wind. Take your child outside and make a necklace of clover flower.  If there' a creek nearby, let him put hi foot in. Find blackberrie and pick them. If you have woods, encourage a fort.    Oh, brave, new mom am I. A few day thi summer, I let my two boys, age 7 and 9, ride their bike with neighbor children to a nearby creek. They wad and play and had a picnic. The boogie man didn't get them; a snake didn't get them (though they did see a snake).  We call these day \\"wander days,\\" quot a children' book we like. They'll remember these wander day much longer than any trip to the local science museum.    Thanks, Louv. Thi book i an act of love for youngsters.
An Excellent Introduction to Ramtha and hi Teachings,The book comprise of: <br />A forward by the channel, JZ Knight (the only human be that Ramtha ha channell through). <br />An introductory essay describ Ramtha' teaching <br />Part 1.  The Autobiography of Ramtha' life <br />Part 2.  The Fundamental concept of the teachings. <br /> <br /> <br />The Introductory Essay describe the background to Ramtha' teaching and highlight their uniqueness.  Not only do they addres the fundamental question of our origin and nature, but they deliver a comprehensive legacy of knowledge bas on pure reason and science.  Coupl with this, are discipline which give the student a mean to experience and verify the philosophical aspect of the teachings, thu consolidat the knowledge a their own wisdom and personal truth. <br />Ramtha' School of Enlightenment (RSE) i liken to the ancient mystery school of Egypt, Greece and Persia.  A a school, it provide the fertile ground in which the student can expand and liberate their mind from their old indoctrination and find their freedom through the exploration of their spiritual nature. <br /> <br /> <br />Part 1 <br />Ramtha the Enlighten One talk of hi life 35,000 year ago and what l him to become a great warrior and conqueror.  He describe hi recovery after be run through by a sword which l to hi own self mastery and final ascension in front of hi 2 million strong army. <br /> <br /> <br />Part 2 <br />Ramtha discusse our origin from the Void, the creation of time and the eventual evolution of the human form.  He describe the nature of God - the Observer and how reality i formed.  In addition, he explain how the brain works, the electromagnetic field around the body and how we can change.  He also addresse the concept of hope and the problem we experience with doubt and how every thought we have i constantly shap our reality <br /> <br /> <br />Thi i a fabulou book for anyone seek answer to these fundamental questions.  Iti especially complementary with many of the popular quantum physic book such a The Self Aware Universe by Amit Gotswami, The Field by Lynne McTaggart or Parallel Universe by Fr Alan Wolf. <br /> <br /> <br />
An excellent reference, not for beginners,Step by step instruction i lack and certain fundamental idea are assum to be known and understood by the reader...  a complete beginner would be lost with thi book alone.  It i an invaluable reference for someone who ha a certain level of practical experience, but a book like Don Kraig' Modern Magick would be preferable to start with. <br /> <br />That be said, it i a virtual \\"must have\\" in the library of any seriou magician, be they traditional GD, thelemite, aurum solis, or of any other western tradition.
WHY NOT PRACTICE FREE ENTERPRISE?,Thi book isn't merely a primer for capitalist thinking, it i a Bible for free enterprise.  Everyone on the planet should read MILLIONAIRE REPUBLICAN, then utilize the implement provided.  The result would be a peaceful, hard-work universe. <br /> <br />I look forward to the day Mr. Root become a novelist and weave hi philosophy through the prism of fiction.  MOVE OVER, AYN RAND.
Amazing.,<br />Thi i a brilliant, brilliant book. It' very stylish and it explain everyth in a clear,  thoughtful intelligent way.

Get it and your life will change. <br /> Mine did!
An engag study,Kim' work ha won the praise of many, not least Robert Aitken Roshi, an American with a lifetime' experience of Zen training. In hi foreword to the third edition, Aitken Roshi stated:   <br /> <br /> \\"thi revis edition . . .now include many new translation and studie of Dogen, and thu it i most welcome. Dogen wrote at the outermost edge of human communication, touch with every sentence such mysterie a self and other, self and non-self, meditation and realization, the temporal and the timeless, form and the void.@He wrote of the attitude necessary for understanding, of the practice required. . .of the variou insight that emerge, and of the many pitfalls. He did not generally write for beginner - most of hi point require very careful study and a few of them elude almost everybody. These challenge are compound by hi creative use of the Japanese language. It ha been said that he wrote in \\"Dogenese,\\" for he made verb of nouns, noun of verbs, creat new metaphors, and manipulat old saying to present hi particular understanding. . . \\"  <br /> <br /> Prof. Kim' study ha been bas on a careful read of Dogen' chosen idioms. He ha endeavour to amplify Dogen' understand of 'do-ri' - or 'reason of the way.' Kim i keen to show that Dogen' use of Zen language i not merely provisional or instrumental, but embodie a 'realisational' dimension. Thi i exemplifi in the notion of the 'genjo-koan' or koan realis in the present, which i to say, actualis in every day activity. In thi way, Kim endeavour to show that Dogen' Zen culminate in ' the great way of total exertion' (gujin no daido) or the total actualisation of practice a realization. Kim i a foremost interpreter of Dogen' thought - and, a such, thi book deserve a place in every Buddhist library. My only reservation about thi study, i that it might have made better sense of the question of how the so-call 'instrumentalist' aspect of koan practice relate tothe 'realizational' aspect. Quite rightly, Kim i at pain to point out that account of Zen which stres the 'instrumentalist' view of koan practice - and that alone, are one sided, and he ha therefore endeavour to illustrate a different perspective. However, without reflection, we might be left to conclude that Rinzai Zen favour the 'instrumentalist' view - and Soto, the 'realizational' view. Kim know better, and indeed, in place (p. 165), he ha cit certain remark from Dogen, which concede that the term 'genjo-koan' originat with Engo - a Rinzai master of the Sung, evidently mean that Rinzai practitioner have appreciat the 'realizational' aspect. A such, the critical reference to (Dai-e) Ta-hui which appear elsewhere in the book, seem strangely out of tenor with thi fact. Yuan-wu (Engo) wa Ta-hui' teacher, and the latter must surely have known of hi master' reference to the genjo-koan. Conversely, much a we might identify Dogen' Zen with 'shikantaza' (just-sitting), play down the instrumentalist approach, Dogen also had hi experience of 'cast off mind and body' (shinjindatsuraku) - a breakthrough experience more or les akin to that realis by Rinzai followers. Perhap Prof. Kim will enlighten u on thi unresolv problem, at some future point.
Important wisdom from the Ancients,I am surpris to see so few review here, a thi book ha had such an influence on my life. I do not know how to begin to adequately expres it significance, and perhap that i appropriate. Those who are ready for the knowledge will be drawn to it in a time and manner which i right for them.  <br /> <br />\\"When the ear of the student are ready to hear, then cometh the lip to fill them with Wisdom.\\" -- The Kybalion <br /> <br />Ancient Future i a \\"modern\\" approach to the ancient wisdom of Kemet, which wa pass from lip to ear since pre-diluvian day and then more recently (about a hundr year ago), wa record in a book entitl \\"Kybalion\\". Kybalion ha been out of print for a long time, but can be found if you diligently seek it.
Neal Stephenson lite,In recent years, Stephenson' work ha become increasingly complicated.  The Baroque cycle i a study in intricate plots, character that seem to number in the thousands, and difficult material that i not readily accessible to the average novel reader.  The Cryptonomicon met that description a well, but to a lesser degree.  While I enjoy those book precisely for their complexity, many reader probably found them to be frustrat to read and difficult to follow. <br />  <br />The Stephen Bury novel do not present thi problem for the casual reader.  They are stripp of most of the technical lingo, and they tend to follow more in the footstep of modern thrillers.  The difference between these novel and the average Tom Clancy clone i that they revolve around powerful critique of modern political culture and bureacracies. <br /> <br />The Cobweb i the better of these two novels.  The central critique of the intelligence community i that competence without political acumen i tantamount to career suicide.  The book track the month between Saddam Hussein' invasion of Kuwait and the start of Gulf War I and pose a terrify question: what if the greatest enemie to our national security are the egomaniac at the top of the security apparatus?  Given the event that have transpir in between the writ of thi novel and today, the question rais by thi novel seem prescient. <br /> <br />The one th that i lack from the Stephen Bury novel i the decadence of Stephenson' other works.  Stephenson i a novelist who ha spent page discus the Captain Crunch-eat ritual of one of hi character (Cryptonomicon), the mak of water steel blade (the Baroque Cycle), and other incidental but vastly entertain subject too numerou to mention.  These passage exquisitely sideline the plot of hi book for an exercise in pure intellectual indulgence.  Sadly, you will not find any such passage in thi novel or in Interface.
A book to raise consciousnes and br peace to our world.,Thi book i a must-read for anyone who want to grow spiritually, who want to live a consciou and compassionate life, and who want to contribute to world peace. I have read many book on the topic of vegetarianism, animal right and animal welfare,  spiritual growth, and peace and nonviolence. Thi book stand alone in it ability to make the connection between all of these subjects. <br /> <br />Will Tuttle, Ph.D. i a rare combination of extraordinary compassion, scholarly research and education, spiritual commitment and wisdom, intuitive insights, and the courage to challenge a worldview which goe back 10,000 year <br />  <br />In thi book, Tuttle explore humanity' relationship with the food we eat.  He point out, very convincingly, that when human began herd animals, it began to create a consciousnes of exploitation which then spread to the control and domination of other humans, a well a animals.  So the root of human' violence to human are found in the practice of see animal a object to exploit for our own purposes: for food, furs, labor, entertainment, \\"sport\\" and experimentation. The use of human a slave and the subjugation of women follow the subjugation and enslavement of animals. <br /> <br />One th that set thi book apart from any of the other that describe the problem associat with a meat-bas diet i the focu on the spiritual aspect of our diet.  When we take food into our bodies, we are also ingest the energy contain in thi food. Animal that are tortur and fill with terror and agony a they are kill are fill with thi very negative energy.  When human eat their flesh, we are also ingest thi fear and anger. Thi affect u deeply.  We cannot live with peace in our heart a long a we are fill our bodie with the pain and suffer of other beings. <br />   <br />Tuttle help u to see that none of u have actually chosen a diet bas upon meat. Our mother f u meat from our infancy.A we got old enough to understand that we were eat animals, we were told that animal were put here for u to eat, so it wa okay.  We didn't question this, any more than we question wear clothe or tak baths. Thus, we absorb the acceptance of exploitation of animal so naturally that we didn't know it wa happening.  And be unconscious, it i hard to recognize the violence that i part of our everyday live through the eat of animals.  Therefore, it i also hard to recognize how insensitive we have become to violence, because we have to protect ourselve from an awarenes of the violence we are part of 3 time a day.   <br />  <br />Thi i a very important book for everyone who want their live to contribute to more peace in the world, rather than more suffer and violence.  <br />  <br />
Church in crisis? Donald to the rescue!,Thank goodness! Over 2,000 + year of bor old tradition, square churches, and legalism can now be correct by Donald Miller.  Thi guy move from Texa to Oregon and realize he ne a bigger suitcase to move Christianity with him: Extreme faith makeover, Christianity addition. I discern two point from thi book: (1) smok and drink are not sin and (2) Christian don't all think like fundamentalists.

Most Inspir Book Of 2005: An Unreasonable Woman,Reasonably speaking, \\"Unreasonable Woman\\" i the most inspir and inspir book I've read all year.    In thi true life story, which represent yet another publish coup by Vermont independent Chelsea Green Pres ([...]), Diane Wilson - work clas shrimp boat captain and mother of five - recount the often-harrow account of her five year fight to hold corporate polluter Formosa Plastic to a \\"zero emissions\\" policy for their insidiou (but all too typical) waste disposal method in Wilson' town of Sea Drift, Texas.    And get this.    Wilson won.    How she defeat the machination of one of the world' largest and most powerful industrial polluter i the subject of the book, which also offer honest insight into life in a southern seaside work clas community from a woman' point of view, a community that I never knew exist (though the EPA rank it a one of the most pollut countie in the country).     And who out there know women can captain shrimp boats? Or understand that women actually can play character other than vamp or victims? I've read book populat with women all my life, but until thi real life story, I've never met a woman like Diane Wilson. In a literary world dripp with testosterone, car chases, and gun play, Wilson i no shrink violet, no damsel in distress.     Exactly the opposite. She intuit her way through what become one of the most courageou struggle for justice  I've read in a long while, challeng corporate control over our economic and political life with grit, good humor, and vernacular insight that, while uneven in some places, made me laugh and cry and cheer and buy copie of thi book for friend and family.    She also, in the most wry and self-deprecat way imaginable, made most of the men in her life look like pantywaist by comparison.     Book like an \\"Unreasonable Woman\\" come along only rarely. Diane Wilson i a work clas heroine with heart, an activist with the gut to do somethingabout the problem confront her. The world i a better place for hav her and her story in it.     If you are not inspir after read thi book, it might be time to forgo read altogether.
Solid Book About Fac Death and Kill in War,Whether intentional or not, thi book' audience i the former or current military member.  But if you have read and enjoy work such a the first two volume of \\"Root of Strategy\\", you should have no trouble follow thi book.    The author successfully show that military personnel have mix feeling about war.  Although he addresse behavior in the midst of battle, the author seem more interest in the view about war held by those outside war itself, i.e., those who had not yet experienc it and those who were look backward in retrospect.  How those people felt in the midst of the madnes i almost certainly different from how they anticipat or how they adjust their feeling afterwards.  I think thi \\"flavor\\" derive from hi personal-interview-and-historical-research approach.  I do not see thi a a negative but rather stay within hi scope of knowledge and expertise.    The review titl \\"Flaw work of a historian with no sociological credibility\\" seem too harshly critical.  Perhap thi reviewer expect a highly technical, in-depth psychological approach.  A a note: page 58 cite S.L.A. Marshall a stat that only \\"some 15 per cent of American infantrymen fired.\\"  True, the subject of women in the military i barely broached.  However, in all fairness, the author never pretend to have extensive knowledge about how women react in battle and simply doesn't go there.  Perhap that i a deficiency of character, but not of the book.  I get the feel that thi review didn't find what he want and then \\"skimmed\\" the book without think into what wa be presented.      Although now much more interest in peace studies, I enjoy read thi book.  I found a number of passage that sh light on where I have been and where I seek to go.  I don't see thi a a pro-military book although at time it may seem so.  I characterize it a an honest endeavor to addres and understand some of the difficult question that most of u have concern death and kill in war-time.
The PERFECT resource for ghost hunters!,<br />Finally! <br />I love thi book -- I've been ghost hunt for year now and I can't believe it took thi long to see a directory come out that' written by the actual ghost hunters. I only wish there were more location in my state, but I gues if the book cover every haunt location there i with thi level of detail the book would be about a million pages. I also love some of the ghost photo with some of the entries!
John Quincy Adams,John Quincy Adams, son of John Adams, the second President, wa one of America' greatest diplomats. He made a name for himself a the country wa be formed, especially with hi defense of \\"the rule of law\\" against the will of the majority. He wa one of the last of the old Federalists. He wa a foreign minister to Holland, Portugal, and Prussia, and wa Secretary of State under Monroe (where he wa the main force in establish the Monroe Doctrine). He became the sixth President in a controversial election that wa decid in the House of Representatives.<br /><br />Parson' short (272 pages) but thorough and well-written biography of Adam i a job well done. She detail the accomplishment of hi life, but focuse primarily on the man himself. Adam wa a stern man (hi portrait remind me of some evil Dicken character, Marley perhaps), and not well-lik by the public. He believ that one should not \\"run\\" for a political office, but should just accept it if offer (imagine that today!). He hat Andrew Jackson and slavery, and fought hard against both. Thi i an excellent book on an interest man.
A Helpful Primer on Mystical Thought,There' a lot of useful information in thi book, and it may be the only place to get all of that knowledge in a single volume.  You'll ne some read stamina, because it' long and part of it are uninteresting.  Hall' fact are wrong in a couple of place (just a few examples: hi chapter on Islam i pretty much worthless, and since when wa Thor' hammer made of ram' horns?) and he seem to have an axe to grind, in term of link Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism to Pythagoreanism, Alchemy, etc etc to the shadowy Illuminati pull the string behind the formation of the Unit State and it model of government.  America supposedly ha some sort of Mystical Destiny that wa predetermin by a group of Immortal Magi, the true initiate of the Elysian and Hermetic mysteries, and so on.  Please .. tone down the crazy just a bit, Mr. Hall! <br />You'll have to read with a slightly critical eye to pick out which part of thi book are useful to you and which part are not, but overall it i definitely worth the effort.  I wa introduc to a lot of new ideas.  One of the benefit of mysticism i the new perspective it can give you, a new way of perceiv the same old thing you've been look at all your life.  There are profound secret everywhere which will reveal themselve to the one who make the EFFORT to discover them. <br />A far a thi book be \\"evil,\\" it just plain isn't.  It may pose a challenge to the dogmatic status-quo of the current dominant religion (which incidentally, i fail to meet the ne of modern civilization) ... but that religion itself wa regard a a threaten evil 2000 year ago when it encroach on the very Mysterie which Hall elucidate in thi book.  The only \\"evil\\" be perpetrat i by those who would - for their own selfish reason - keep humanity in spiritual darkness.  So there.

The man, the monster, the legend.,Champlin bravely assert hi own contribution to the great wealth of Neronian scholarship for the critic to pick apart. I find very little to quibble about.<br />It i difficult to write even-handedly about Nero for a Western audience. Who could forget the image of a man who \\"fiddl while Rome burned\\" or the terrible tyrant who had begun a nearly 170 year \\"persecution\\" of the early Christians, under whose reign both Peter and Paul were executed? A other reviewer comment reveal, you can easily earn the brand of a Nero \\"apologist\\" if you don't tow the party line, however inaccurate it might be.<br /><br />Champlin' thesi can be stat simply a follows: many, if not most of Nero' grandstand and outrageou actions, were perform out of considerable political shrewdnes and calculation - not the madnes or puerile exces wrongly attribut to a \\"live fast, die young, and leave a good look corpse\\" emperor. Nero' success, Champlin argue in the first chapter, i evinc by a shockingly prolong \\"afterlife\\" manifest in pseudo-Neros, Judeo-Christian apocalyptic writings, and a disenfranchis populace openly lament hi death. Nonetheless, I cannot help but wonder, (work on the same assumption,) whether he had truly orchestrat hi public relation a well a Champlin suggest given hi untimely demise at age 30.<br /><br />Some reviewer disagree, but I reckon Champlin' original Nero-Periander link to be one of the most intrigu idea in ancient biography I've ever seen. The ambivalent relationship with the mother, the Philhellenism, the artistic bent, and the numerou other link are too compell to ignore outright, even if the conclusion a hard sell. Further research i warranted, but I suspect that Champlin, with hi great intellect and energy, may have already exhaust all of the available evidence for advanc hi thesis. He demonstrate the Augustus/Antony connection thoroughly. The discussion of the great fire of 64 i arrestingly well done: after convincingly present the defense for Nero' innocence, he suddenly shatter the deception in stat that despite thi prec evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration. It hit you with dramatic effect almost equal to one of the primary source compri the centerpiece of hi proof in thi sudden reversal: Tacitus' Annale XV.67.<br /><br />Champlin' organization i somewhat bothersome a it i in \\"Final Judgments,\\" because he reject chronological arrangement for thematic foci. Thi require repetition of several facts, and I cannot understand hi reason for the chapter order. The post-mortem legacy of Nero, be most fascinating, he put up front obviously to hook hi reader. It serve a an interest set piece for further discourse, because the inevitable wonder we feel about Nero' impression on the world ever after demand explanation: thu the rest of the book. But with Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitu unfold the bulk of their own historie so methodically, the rearrangement isn't alway a neat fit. Still, Champlin' brilliant weav together of hundr of sources, a before, vindicate hi literary decision several time over.<br /><br />Champlin, like any other historian, ha hi hypothese and direct hi evidence toward prov them. Hi presentation however, i replete with past scholarship and primary source present candidly and fairly. One of the most appreciable inclusion i the extensive collection of Latin graffiti, which add a critical dimension to our knowledge. Thi book ha been for me an introduction into full-strength Neronian scholarship and I found it both accessible and empower enough to read further with confidence.ngly present the defense for Nero' innocence, he suddenly shatter the deception in stat that despite thi prec evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration.

Not the *official* new siddur...,Reader may be confus by the description of thi book a the `long-await new prayer book' of the Reform movement because of the authorship by Stern. It i not. That siddur i call Mishkan T'filah (Tabernacle of Prayer) and ha not yet been made available to the public. No slight intend to Mr. Stern, who ha apparently incorporat the same change agre by the Reform movement into hi version, but thi really should be made clear in the description of the book.
Not for the little ones,The picture in thi book are great, but the theme i not for little ones.  In fact, it i a recipe for bad dreams.  My three year old doe not ne to think about frog fly in through her window, frog cha dog out of the house, and the like at bedtime in a 50' Sci-Fi look.  An award winner for art, yes.  An award winner a a children' story, NO!
A book for the ages,Thi book i famou for it unique method. It attempt to establish what Hitler knew and when he knew it. In effect, it i written from Hitler' point of view. The event are narrat in the order Hitler experienc them, and a he experienc them. Thu one get a vivid feel of be present a history unfolds, an experience stolen by \\"omiscient\\" historian and biographers. Of course Irv also include a huge amount of information glean from sometime exclusive interview with witnesse and participants. Thi book ha been controversial since it first appear in the 1970s. It ha been publicly criticiz by many historians. But it ha also been tacitly prais by them, insoar a they have borrow heavily from Irving' research.
Get the Right Edition,I highly recommend you get thi book. Just make sure that you purchase ISBN: 0800757394, the one with the black cover and yellow writing. The other edition i a modern \\"update\\" that ha the power of Bosworth' teach stripp from it.
Renew the Shadows,Shadowrun ha alway been about change, adaptation, and grow from the issue of the past. With each new edition that ha arriv since the game' conception back in 1989, a new set of rules, more stream lined, more focus on fun rather than rule mongering, ha arisen. Shadowrun 4th edition i the biggest rule change yet.<br /><br />Vet' to the game who enjoy the game for it' rule's, not it' gam world, have voic their distaste for the game. I myself wa very skeptical of these completely new rules. Let me clarify now, thi game ha inde evolved, and these new rule are a step in the right direction. Player of game like Vampire: the Masquarde/the Requiem, Werewolf: the Apocalypse/the Forsaken, and other World of Darknes 1.0 and 2.0 game wil find these rule a bit familiar and comforting.<br /><br />Dice test are no long single skill with the hopeful add of a combat or specialty dice pool. Instead, test are made combin attribute and skill into a combin pool, and all test aim for the same Target Number \\"Hit\\" of 5. Modifier just add or take away dice now, and the rule of one ha been completly reworked.<br /><br />Thus, all vet to the game line will have to learn a whole new set of rule if htey want to stay alive in the shadows, but that' someth they should be us to, adaptation.<br /><br />New Gamer will find these new rule set much easier to approach than the older sets. While it feel like character creation i more complicat (which i someth shadowrun ha been known for), gameplay i smoother, the game suffer les from the same old \\"specialty classe gett so much alone time while they do their th and everyone else get a big break\\". Instead, with augment realty (a trend most sci fi group seem to be tak these day in Cyberpunk game and stories), group find their Matrix ha join them in the real world.<br /><br />The reason thi game lose a star i because there i a standard warn of skepticism. Vet should be warn of the issue with the chang rules. If you lov the rule system and not the game, thi isn't an edition you want to pick up. If you want to adapt, and learn a more stream lin system, pick thi book up, or go buy the PDF eBook and debate if it' worth your money to buy the physical book follow up.icism.

Problem with thi edition,I love Aristotle and thi i a good collection, but my book fell apart!  I had a course that us just thi book, and despite the fact that we all took good care of our copies, nearly all of our book tore in half or lost pages.  Some actually had to make a new book out of it!
The messenger commit suicide.,While I don't alway agree with hi TV analysis, I enjoy Mr. Crawford' commentaries. Hi book, however, i surprisingly shallow and can be summ up in one chapter with footnotes. I didn't realize an intentional misquot of Thoma Jefferson on page 2 (easy enough to catch a the footnote provide the actual quote) wa a foreshadow of the paraphra to come. Almost all hi source are the very media he criticizes.    Yes, the media should be astute and critical of anyone in power anywhere, yet it isn't, mostly because it ha been corporatized. vilifi and because reporter and organization have wimp out. OK, yes, and....?     Since Crawford i a journalist, one who claim an inside view of what really goe on, he i obligat by the same standard he pose not just to say thi i what went on, but to explain why manipulation i allow and what to do about it. Tom Fenton in hi book, Bad News, doe a more thorough job of explain the link between money and report and provid a context for media manipulation and journalistic reticence.     Crawford give specific example of manipulation, but doesn't provide motive or context beyond the trite \\"politician manipulate the media so they can look better so they can become powerful.\\" Therein lie the point, if the media i powerful enough that it ne to be manipulated, then it i powerful enough to hold it own. Why hasn't the media held it own and why aren't people demand a real public discussion? What doe the messenger do with the message he wa suppos to deliver?    Crawford say people are tun to outlet to verify their belief so new outlet are becom customer-driven reinforc agents. If that' true, why i the media mak that choice instead of tak the lead? Politician do attack the messenger, but often they don't have to, because the messenger ha been co-opted. More dangerously, by giv hyperbole public time and space, the new media cut it own throat then call it a tracheotomy.    Still, despite the flaws, I stay with the book' limit scope until page 117. \\"I don't vote....\\" With that, Crawford' credibility flew out the window.     \\"I fear it will make it more difficult to keep my observation down the middle.\\" After 116 page of caterwall about professional and personal responsibility, about the consequence to democracy of a media manipulat by power, about how the media i responsible to it constituents, the public, and should judge both the quality and importance of it \\"message,\\" Crawford absolve himself of any duty, responsibility or personal judgment. Hi book become a version of \\"do a I say, not a I do.\\" Worse yet, the core of hi argument i a tautology: journalist must give up the right and responsibilitie of citizenship to uphold the right and responsibilitite of citizenship. Talk about attack the messenger, the messenger just committ suicide.     Come on, get in the muck with the rest of us, make tough decisions, make judgments. It' in the choo that one gain perspective and insight. Not vot because you're a journalist i like say a Yankee fan can't write about baseball or decid not to eat anything, ever, so no one will know you don't like brocolli.    A Jim Hightower put it, \\"There ain't nothin' in the middle of the road but yellow stripe and dead armadillos.\\"
Let' be realistic,Now that all the friend and family have promot the book... <br /> <br />In order to understand someth new, we all must relate that which we're learn to that which we already know. <br />Pete and Bill have a difficult time transition from campy comedian to thoughtful educators. To thi extent, their writ style lack any useful analogie whatsoever which might bridge the gap between the known and the unknown. <br /> <br />The book i full of droll and distract fantasy reference which are completely irrelevant to the subject matter, and are prone to tak the unsuspect reader off task. <br /> <br />The potential purchaser should also be forewarn that the author tend toward another immature trait of attempt to impres the reader with their linguistic abilities. Yet, to be effective at teach they should have remember to never use a complicat word where a simple one will do. <br /> <br />Many example are rambl and inconcise, where step-by-step quickly degrade into an ambiguou and vague path. <br /> <br />Not every developer can obtain DOMAIN Authority in order to issue SSL certificate and it' too bad that the author don't allow for thi type of scenario, especially when a report system i on a VPN. <br /> <br />All of the content i there, but it' up to the reader to filter and translate most of it from the pitfall aforemention into someth more to the center of the bell curve. <br /> <br />
A must own!,Dobson begin her easy-to-read book with chapter appropriately titl \\"Help Your Child Love Learning\\" and \\"Creat Your Own Educational Reform\\". After read just these two chapter I wa already in love with the book.<br /><br />The remain chapter consist of reader contribut ideas, lesson and games. These parent know how to make education so fun the kid probably won't even know they are learning! The idea are easy, fast, inexpensive, and usually involve minimal research.<br /><br />What really make thi book stand far and above other i Table 2.2, found on page 34-37. Thi helpful table list many popular off-the-shelf curriculum that can be easily recreat at home with material you already have, or can be found us - all for under $100!<br /><br />Thi book i truly ingenious! It' about time someone organiz the idea of creative parent into one handy reference. I cannot think of a better person to present thi material other a personal favorite, Linda Dobson.
Useful storie & ideas, presentation lacking,I have been listen to many of these Sound True and similar audiocassette recently, look for good meditation material.  Fortunately, since the exploration i pretty hit-or-mis for me, the Seattle library ha a lot of them (includ thi one), so I am able to preview them.  For my taste, The Second Half of Life i better in it intention than it execution.  Overall, for my money, a more successful work (also available both at Amazon and the Seattle library) i A Woman' Spiritual Retreat: Teaching, Meditations, and Ritual to Celebrate Your Authentic Feminine Wisdom, by Joan Borysenko.  Although it focuse primarily on women' wisdom and growth, a oppos to second-half-of-life wisdom and growth, it hit a lot of the same note and also draw on myth and ritual.  (Another, much shorter work in a similar vein that I also found more successful i the meditation CD, Celtic Spirit Meditations, by Mara Freeman--also available at Amazon and review by me here.)     Certainly, the intention of The Second Half of Life i to help people do some positive growth in their later years, draw on wisdom of many cultures, and a the positive review attest, it doe accomplish thi very well for some people.  However, for me, Ms. Arrien pick some good myths, tale and theme for her foundation, but then doesn't do enough substantive and rigorou work with them.  The basic pattern (except for the Preferential Shape exercise, see below) i to tell a tale or introduce a character or concept, give her interpretation (which often seem either too simplistic and schematic or too arbitrary, a other reviewer have noted), and then to say, \\"So where am I with __________ in my life?\\" [Fill in the blank with the theme or symbol just discussed.] The psychologiz offered, although constructive, seems--well, mostly self-evident.  To someone who grew up lov much of the original source material in it pure, story form, some of the interpretation actually diminish the stories'inherent symbolic meaning.      I did find both the description and the interpretation of the Nine Muse pretty good, and wa pleas to come acros a theme I'd been look for but hadn't found elsewhere (except in Layne Redmond' wonderful music CD Invok the Muse, also available on Amazon).  The Pandora' Box story ha an interest comparison of thi myth in different culture (includ what wa left in the bottom of the box, accord to the different cultures).  The Preferential Shape section give you someth specific to do, an exercise with your preference for five universal shapes. I found thi exercise to provide some helpful insights, albeit in a fortune-tell kind of way.  The 12 Labor of Hercule got a retell that wa somehow both cursory and redundant, and the interpretation here felt especially arbitrary and forc to me.  Like another reviewer, I found the Eight Gate rather suspect in how Ms. Arrien drew together element supposedly from many source to arrive at thi particular interpretation (and I also could have done without the gnomes!), although there i some good material about initiation and transition here.  Overall, there seem to be a lot of focu on schematic, numbered, arbitrary hierarchies.     I also found the material overall to be too repetitive and slow-moving, and like another reviewer with the same problem, wa irk by the verbal delivery (the uneven rhythm, the tone, and a tendency to do repetition of phrase that did not feel naturally emphatic and became quite irritating).  It would be nice if Amazon would provide not only the Search Inside Thi Book function for book on tape (sadly mis here), so that people can get an idea of the specific content and tone, but also audioclip for book on tape, a they do for music CDs.  These audiocassette are often quite pricey, and long, and one' personal reaction to the voice of the narrator i pretty important.  The Sound True website doe have audio sample formany of their authors' items, includ thi one.
An Interest Outsider' Look at North Korea,Thi short graphic novel by French Canadian Guy Delisle manag to be humorou and frighten at once. It' a story of hi two-month stay in Pyongyang while oversee the production of a popular French children' cartoon. Delisle i not lost on the sad irony of hi position, and tell hi story simply and without pretense.<br /><br />The book deal mainly with how frustrat life i in the capital, even for a privileg foreigner like him: bad food, constant surveillance, blar propanda songs, etc.<br /><br />It' probably most affect when you get a real sense of the inner live of hi guide and translator. Both are very buttoned-up, proper and repressed. At one point Delisle lend one of them hi copy of \\"1984\\"; when the guy return it a week later he seem very nervou and mutter someth about how he \\"doesn't like science fiction.\\" On the other hand, he rejoice when he get a bottle of Hennessy a a going-away present.<br /><br />In the most terrify episode Delisle ask hi guide where all the handicapp people are in Pyongyang, and the guide respond that there aren't any handicapp people in North Korea. Yikes!<br /><br />Highly recommend to any fan of first-person graphic journalism.

A Must Read But Some Caveats,It i to Jane Hyun' credit to discus issue of Asian American professional on a very practical level. There are however, some caveat for the reader. The book ne to be contextualiz within a larger conceptual framework. The overarch issue are ignor within her practical framework, namely: Who ne to change? Who ne to accommodate whom?  How much? What are the risk and benefits? Her book appear to be say that corporate America ne to understand Asians, but it doe not ne to change.  Rather it i the Asian professional that ne to change and adapt. <br /> <br />I the book too heavily assimilationist?  It i not clear a Hyun doe make a distinction early in her book between assimilation (\\"adopt ...at the expense of one' own cultural characteristics\\") and acculturation (\\"adapt ...while continu to maintain values, perspectives, and feature of one' native culture\\"). <br /> <br />There appear to be little adaptation of any Asian model or perspective to the mainstream USA corporate culture -- page 279 suggest two ways: \\"Develop cultural competency\\" and \\"Make use of your bicultural and bilingual abilities.\\" While recogniz the dominance of USA/Western research and model in the busines world, it i also logical and no \\"one model fit all.\\" Perhap future research and practice can provide indigenou Asian model or perspective that can be adapt and work effectively in coporate America or other cultures.  The Special Issue on China & India (Busines Week, August 22/29, 2005) point out how some USA busines model are not applicable. <br /> <br />It i not an either/or proposition.  By utiliz the juxtaposition of the Asian behavior/value system versu the Western behavior/value system to present her central thesis, Hyun create a false dichotomy in the mind of the reader. Current busines literature i fill with exhortation of \\"win/win,\\" \\"both/and,\\" \\"alignment,\\" and \\"interdependence\\" -- all very Asian concepts. These traditional Asian cultural value are at the very heart of what contemporary corporate America i try to effect in order to add value. So there i a \\"baby with the bath water\\" caveat here to the reader.  The accommodation ne to be reciprocal, not unilateral. <br /> <br />In her Epilogue, Hyun encourage the reader to \\"Develop an Action Plan That Work with Your Persona.\\"  It seem throughout her book that the emphasi i on ask the reader to tailor hi or her persona to that which i requir for succes in corporate America, not on utiliz the behavioral strength and cognitive position with which someone who come with a strong Asian cultural background i imbued.  Be Asian -- it seem to Hyun -- put one in a deficit position. <br /> <br />The reader ne to be cautiou in the self-assessment, individual profiles, exercise and tool cited. They yield helpful descriptive self-awarenes profile and information, not diagnostic or predictive profiles, and they are dependent on situational factors. There are many suggestions, bas perhap on many year of experience, but empirical data demonstrat their reliability, validity or efficacy are not mentioned. <br /> <br />Kudo to Hyun for encourag the seek of regular and frequent performance feedback. Thi i a career self-monitor technique that i utiliz far too little by all employee to help document and strengthen request for job and salary advancement.  In spite of the conceptual conundrums, thi highly practical book i a must read. <br /> <br />Adrian Chan (Kochman Mavreli Associates, Oak Park, IL) & Barry Mar (Management & Resource Associates, Seattle, WA) <br />
Not really what I wa look for,Child like projects.  Look for someth a little more advanced.  Didn't find a project I would use.  Although, I may use some of the pattern on other items.
Beautiful,Rumi ne no praise from me and Barks' translation i beautiful, mysterious, and urgent.  I find hi introduction to the many section especially moving.  My only problem i that I order the book after I bought Barks' \\"The Essential Rumi,\\" which chang me.  Thi book ha many overlaps.  I'd have preferr to see more original translations, but a a first introduction, you can do no better.
Lone Classicist,The Denniston text i an extremely useful resource that any classicist should have in front of them when work with primary source material from ancient Greece.  The organization of the book facilitate ease of use, and the entrie are fill with example taken from antiquity.  Compar the entrie on particle in Denniston with those in Smyth greatly add another level of understand to the project of translation.
Big and Comprehensive,Just want to clarify how to  use the Emanuel Contract book:<br /><br />I recommend it a a semester-long guide. Thi will help you flesh out the vari topic and clarify them a you are read your casebook. Thi book recommend read your casebook first, then referr to the same topic in thi volume to ensure you understand the material--thi should be done before you encounter the material in class, preferably.<br /><br />If you're look for someth to pick up midway dur the semester or just before finals, I think the Crunchtime serie by the same publisher i a better choice.
Interesting,Although not quite what I expected, thi book wa far from be a disappointment.  It i not solely focus on women dress a angels, it i mainly an erotic Fantasy Photography book.  9 photographer from North-central europe are featured, with more than 10 photograph from each.  Style differ, from body-paint (for a comic-book effect) to completely photoshopp setting and landscapes, to a contortionist/dancer - but alway the theme remains, the female in way you probably have not seen before.
Recalcitrant Indecisiveness,Thi book explore several themes. First, it speak in generalitie to the rise of the Profession of Arm and talk about the development of professional officers. The second major theme i that it dicusse command and control and the execution and management of violence. the thesi i that decision making, technology and professionalism are essential tool that now become part of the overall thought, deliberate strategy plann and development proces of the military. Thirdly, it speak to and explore tactical decisivenes and lastly, it speak to international law and custom.<br /><br />All in all thi i a great book, but dont expect that the conclusion or answer to these theme will alway jump out at you. You will ne to read with intention to discern these 4 themes, and some others, and how they may or may not apply to your contemporary comparison of Modern war, that i from roughly WW II to the Gulf War of 90-91 and Post-Modern War, that is, current warfare post 9-11.<br /><br />Thi two hundr year work of analysi end where it begins. With the analysi of a decisive battle. The last 8 page sum up a few of the auhtor conclusions; one that come to mind i the political-military-busines train and role that officer must have in order to perform there military role effectively.<br /><br />The greatest benefit of thi book will be deriv when one compare post modern war with the tactical lesson of the battlefield.<br /><br />The academic debate rages, and will continue to rage over whether or not there i such a th a the decisive battle. You will ne to discern for yourself if the principle of war have chang and if the tactical execution of the battle ha a direct correlation to the operational, strategic and or political aspect of war.<br /><br />ps. read thi book slowly and with intention, there i much to absorb here.<br /><br />Terry Tucker, Prof Military Studies/History<br /><br />Senior Doctrine Developer SANGMP
Best book on writing...,Pound for pound, thi may be the best book on, about, or for aspir writers.   <br /> <br />I have read at least 10 book on the craft of writ and a bunch on theory and technique... thi book i right up there with the best of the best.  If you couple thi book with Raymond Carver' posthumou \\"Call if You Ne Me\\" and mix in a few careful reading of any Richard Yate interview, you've got yourself some tough rope to tow.  But if you want to be a strong writer, suck it up and do it anyway! <br /> <br />I hold a BA in fiction writing.  I also tend to write literary realist fiction.  If you are of the same mind, thi book will help you tremendously.  It i brutal in it' explanation of what to steer clear of and what to include, but that i how it should be.  If you take writ very seriously, and want to take it to the next level, thi book i a great start. <br /> <br />You can't go wrong when you have advice from C. Michael Curti (Fiction Editor of the most prominent publication in America) and Frank Conroy (Chairman to the most prestegiou writ institute in America.)  Pay attention folks.  Thi i the real deal.  Add in some very helpful workshop activite from one Tom Bailey (only a head writ professor at Harvard) and some very heartfelt tip from a true master like Dubus... Forget about it! <br /> <br />\\"On becom a Novelist\\" wa good.  \\"ABC of Reading\\" wa good.  \\"The Lonely Voice\\" wa decent.  Forster' guidance wa revolutionary, but thi book i perfect for now.  Go buy it and then read all the Carver and Yate and Dubu and Wolff you can get your grubby little hand on.  You'll be a better writer for it.  Trust me!
A Great Read For Anyone!,Thi book i a great read for market researcher and the general population alike.  Dr. McEwen ha put together a truly compell \\"tale\\" of how certain brand entice followings, and how or why said following are either maintain and groomed, or discarded.  A fascinat cultural study, a well a a meticulou scientific one, thi i a great present for anyone who' ever wonder how Disney or Coca Cola ha come to the prominence they enjoy today.  To have put together so much information in such a fun, readable way i Dr. McEwen' true gift, and he should be laud for it.  Bravo!
Warm over leftovers,To hi discredit, Dr. Unwin virtually brag in the introductory chapter that nearly all of the question and argument that have mystifi pterosaur since their discovery have been answer in recent years,  but when it come time to reveal those answers, Unwin typically sidesteps. Origins? Still not sure. Family tree? With over a hundr genera to choose from,  and many recently discovered, Unwin fall back on a favorite few and place them on an antique tree, not a modern cladogram. While Unwin' writ style i refresh and easy to read (every chapter open with short fiction), and hi photo are first rate, the line work i rarely original and never detailed. Almost noth i shown from the neck down. Only skull are presented. Most, if not all, of the drawing  are recognizable from other sources. So, a disappoint reader here.
Beware the positive reviews!,<br />Thi book should be illegal for be hideously dangerou to your health, but the first amendment doe allow thi abhorrent man to publish hi little book. <br /> <br />In regard to the positive review I just read, please note that \\"The Lost Reviewer\\"' critique i an obviou puff-piece.  Check out the other review under the same name of 'Kelvin' and you'll find an Oct. 11 review of the same book that i completely scathing.  Hmmm...be paid to write reviews, are we?  Amazon should take action on this. <br /> <br />Only the very gullible or desperate will buy thi book.  I wouldn't use it a toilet paper.
Highly Recommended!,When sport figure write book on leadership, they often take the easy route - athletic metaphors, game time war stories, tenuou application of sport experience to business. Thi refresh book break through such superficial idea a decisively a a dunk by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in hi prime. Ten-time national champion UCLA basketball coach John Wooden - generally consider the greatest college basketball coach to ever hold a clipboard - deliver a leadership book that stand alone at center court. Remarkably, none of Wooden' player recall him urg them to win. Instead, he urg them to do their best every moment. Take care of the process, he says, and the result will take care of itself. To Wooden, preparation i pivotal and every detail matters. Despite hi almost obsessive focu on gett the little thing right, Wooden believe in balance and consistency. He avoid extremes. Wooden' long-time collaborator and co-author Steve Jamison doe a wonderful job of portraying, through the coach, a range of qualities, philosophie and characteristic that apply to every field. We strongly recommend thi book to manager and executive who want to know how to lead people to victory in every game.
Pack with Knowledge!,Details, details, details. That' really what successful event plann i all about, and that' the key to thi very successful event-plann manual. Author Judy Allen notes, lists, cope with and give an example of virtually every detail in plann anyth from a sedate corporate event in a major city to a huge celebration on a remote island. She provide example galore plu tips, question and answers, sample cost sheet and schedules. How much floor space doe a person ne to be comfortable in a tent? Answer: 20 square feet. How many bathroom should be available for a party? Answer: One per 75 guests. And don't forget to ask about the stemware, adequate park and even the photographer' back-up camera battery. Thi author seem to have thought every contingency, a the book' ambitiou title promises. Her one glar omission i that she doe not include the party planner' fee - our gues i that she'd be worth it. We highly recommend thi well-organized, very practical book to all event planners. Don't send out pres release for your party without consult Judy Allen.
Truly a waste of your time,If you are truly a fan of Kate Bush and her music, DO NOT buy thi book.  Although it title and photo depict Kate, thi novel i not about her.  It' plot revolve around the tediou wandering and musing of a depress individual with low self esteem and body dimorphism.  A other reviewer have already commented, thi i really two books.  The first i the whining of the painfully depress narrator, the second, interspers randomly with the first, i an opinionat biography of Kate.  I suspect that the author i not actually a fan of Kate, and that he only us her name, history, and likenes to capitalize on an establish base of fan who are hungry for anyth new.  Shame on him.  My only hope i that Kate actually read thi drivel and sue him for associat her with such a piece of trash.  Don't waste your time and money.  If you truly want to know about Kate Bush, buy her album and check out some of the web site creat by her fans.  John Mendelssohn, if you read this, on behalf of everyone who ha purchas and read thi book, I demand our time and money back.
Teach Everyone the Rule for Success,After circl the trait I possess on page 59 in the \\"Framework for Understand Poverty\\" and find out I fell mostly in poverty, it wa no wonder I got along better with these student than my colleagues.<br /><br />Thi book not only help teacher understand their students, but help teacher to understand themselve and how they relate to children. By understand our behavior and the behavior of our students, we can move beyond conflict and toward achievement.<br /><br />Thi book i entertaining, informative and career changing.
beautiful, but preache mostly to the converted,It i a lovely book... somewhat surreal and definitely Utopian in theme but Bryant take you so gently and slowly to her thesi that it' ultimately easy-to-swallow. Reflection over time, however, yield a few problems.  <br />A another reviewer ha point out, Bryant use a dispicable character to explain and augment the premise for the culture of Ata; many reader will find it hard to sympathize with hi suppos enlightenment. Also, the id i completely gloss over in thi book, the idea be that  proper socialization within such a  Utopian culture would erase or negate animalistic urge down to permanently manageable magnitude; many reader will question her conclusion in that regard and doubt will emerge on the entire premise. Lastly, the protagonist obtuse nature make the book plod a bit; many reader will \\"get it\\" right away and be annoy with how long it take the main character to catch up (which in some respect he never really does) <br /> <br />Then there' the attitude of the Kin of Ata themselves. While beautiful and lov and empathic and yadda yadda, they can easily come acros a lackadaisical or just plain apathetic. While much i made of their near-telepathic \\"oneness\\" and reliance upon their spiritual nature, their repeat indulgence of the main character become tiresome.... have they no self-preservation? No passion? No overrid discipline? These question are best exemplifi by the fact that the Ata see no benefit from the notion of the written word. Much i made of their connection to one another; their oral history that become the art of storytell etc. Apparently, historical fact-keep i anathema to Utopia. I found that notion to be impossible to accept. Within the framework of a people absolutely cut-off from \\"modern\\" societie influence perhap that could MAYBE be true, but one doe not simply dismis an obstacle to spiritual awaken by push it out of view. Thi come acros a a basic ostrich manuever to avoid fac the difficult realitie of human natures: heirarchical thinking, competivenes and basic surivival ne that when unmet turn to aggression and antagonistic behavior. Those may not be pleasant realitie but they are realities. <br /> <br />For a more interest (and possibly more intellectual) take on the same notion, try out Herland by Charlotte Perkin Gilman. Although her victorian attitude about female sexuality date the piece, all other aspect of her Utopia seem more plausible to me. Which i say something, really.  <br /> <br />Actually, I'd be more enthusiastic to recommend The Dispossess (or nearly anyth by Ursula K LeGuin) or Wild Se (or nearly anyth by Octavia Butler) a both (the book and the writers) explore the notion of a Utopian ideal by hand it to humanity via an alien race who are well aware of the not-so-nice aspect of human nature. Both writer understand that some unsavory element are iron-clad stuck in us, not just taught to us.  <br /> <br />By keep the Utopianist a human a anyone else, we beg the question \\"why do those human never fight, never hurt each other and how would they deal with a natural disaster?\\" which never seem to be answer by Utopian writer adequately. By beginn enlightenment with an outside species/race, we change the question to \\"can humanity resist it negative tendancie in order to accept thi Utopia?\\" which i imminently more interest and quite possibly answerable on some level.  <br /> <br />The Kin of Ata... neither addresse nor firmly answer these questions, which i it' only flaw. For fantasy, however, it sure i a wonderful read.
wealth of information,Not a beginner book, but a more advanc grimoire for the solitary practitioner.  Spells, ritual and practice cover a wide range of ne - circle casting, Esbat rituals, Sabbat Rituals, meditations, basic spells, to clean your crystal and divinations.  She also goe into teas, oil and baths, the foundation for the aromatherapy crazy.  Each divid into well organized, easy-to-follow sections.<br /><br />A with all the Green Witchcraft series, there i a wealth of information just not for the crafter, but endles material to help writer of the paranormal and fantasy categories.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
The only book that give details, and not politics, behind tax plans,Thi book i well written and a focus book that look at chang a terrible tax policy inflict the American People.  I read thi book after hear so much positive and negative around thi issue.  <br /> <br />After read it, I have found that most of the \\"negative\\" review of the fair tax, and the book,  have NO relationship to the Plan or to the book. It seem that there are politic go on in how some people, includ some of the reviewers, interpret the \\"fair tax\\". Instead of review the book, they are mak political statement that meet their ne often twist the plan or compar it to other plan (i.e. VAT) that are false. <br /> <br /> The book specifically addresse the fact and state there i no Plan that i perfect and there i no free lunch.  I recommend you read the book and make up your own mind.   <br />
Thi should be on every therapist' bookshelf,Thi i a book you have to have. It' an `I can't put it down' book. It make you wonder how you ever manag to work with traumatiz client without it. It make you realise why you weren't gett anywhere, why what you were do in therapy wasn't good enough to help client move on from their past trauma. <br /> <br />Traditionally therapy with thi group of client focuss heavily on the trauma. Thi book take the reader beyond that. For once a book i look at more than just the trauma in the past a someth to be dealt with. It show the reader why difficultie today must be tackl in a different way when the client ha a trauma history than with other clients. But it open your eye to way to work with other client too. <br /> <br />When I am ask to recommend a book for therapist with trauma client thi i the one I choose. It i the only book that help one understand why everyday life i so difficult for such clients, someth no other book doe in such depth or in such a useful way. Read thi book i like wak up to what life i really like for thi group of clients; you will never see a client in the same way again. Now you will know why they behave a they do, why mak change i so difficult and why what work with other client group doesn't work so well when the client come from an abusive or neglectful family. <br /> <br />Steve Gold show clearly how incident of abuse are set within a family context that doe not provide the tool for deal with everyday life in an effective manner. Because of the general family context in which ongo abuse occurs, these client have alway lack vital cop mechanism and abilitie that are usually learn dur an adequate childhood. The model propos give one a framework to work effectively and help the client face both the fear of the past and the fear of today. It place the trauma proces within a therapy that enable the client to grow rather than stay focuss on trauma alone. It provide the reader with a model to use to effectively understand, asses and teach the vital abilitie that were never taught in childhood. It open your eye to the context in which these client develop all their strategie to cope, one that do not help them now.   <br /> <br />Thi i a book that mustn't be missed. It i one you will take off the shelf again and again. Whatever DSM category your client fit into, if they have problem that arose from a traumatic childhood thi i the book to guide you. It i the most important book you will ever buy. <br /> <br />
Simple, entertaining!,Never been much for enjoy history, but the style, brevity, and choice of subject matter come together very nicely in thi book.
Attention: Only read the new translation by Tim Wilkinson,Anyone who read the poor first translation of Fateles and the shamefully bad translation of Kaddish cannot even get close to the true spirit of the original works. <br />Thank to Tim Wilkinson English speaker can finally enjoy these excellent books.  <br />Look for the title \\"Fatelessness\\" and \\"Kaddish for an Unborn Child\\", both translat by Wilkinson. These new edition are at last worthy of the original and the Nobel Prize. <br />(See also October 16, 2002 review by Marton Sass) <br />A movie bas on the novel Fateles i also out with English subtitles; don't mis it, if you have a chance. Beautiful work. <br />
A Must Read,Thi i a great read. Everyone should read this, especially if you're one of the few to notice what Levy ha point out. I've been talk about some of these issue mention for a few year now. Or whenever Britney Spears,  Christina Aguliera, Jessica Simpson, and Sex and the City burst onto the pop culture radar. <br /> <br />Levy' writ style i easy to read, not at all distract like some other writer in thi genre, like Naomi Wolf, who take the focu off the material. I really apreciate the chapter devot to the women' movement since I wa born year after and the women' studie clas i recently took fail to cover it. That chapter put some thing in perspective for me. Read thi book. You will not be disappointed.
Grandmum doe it again,Grandmum wa a children' librarian and alway find the great book for my daughter.<br /><br />Thi i a sweet little book that ha become my daughter favorite(she i 4).

PART ENGLISH HISTORY...PART ENGLISH MYSTERY...,Thi i a marvelou and beautifully realiz work of fiction. A someone who enjoy mysteries, a well a historical fiction and gothic novel of suspense, I wa quite taken with thi book. Intricately plotted, the book i clever in it premise. Two disparate human beings, a highly independent, red-head slip of a woman, Samantha Flood, Australian by birth, and a serious, fervently religiou Spaniard, Miguel Madero, who i half-English, find themselve thrust together, a each explore the tiny, remote Cumbrian village of Illthwaite in England, look for answer to their individual quests.  Both are in Illthwaite to get information relative to that which each i seeking. Both are stay in the local inn, call The Stranger House.<br /><br />Samantha i a brilliant but brash mathematician in her early twenties. Fondly known a Sam to her friends, she i interest in trac her familial roots. She ha recently discover that her paternal grandmother wa from thi part of the world,  hav been a part of a huge number of children migrant that had been unceremoniously shipp from England to other part of it Empire, includ Australia.

He is, however, actually in Illthwaite to find out more about an ancestor of hi who mysteriously disappear there centurie ago dur the reign of Queen Elizabeth I.<br /><br />In Illthwaite, Both Sam and Mig find themselve up against obstacle plac in their way. It seem that it resident are not totally forthcom or are reluctant to part with information relative to their respective quests.

immigrant' support,A someone who came to the Unit State fresh after college in the mid-eighties, I ponder the question of my new identity and American identity in general quite often. I pick Mr. Huntington' book in the summer of 2005 and found it to be very enlightening. I find it undeniable the fact that at the origin of the succes of America a a nation and a state lie her British, protestant origins. That origin set the tone of the work ethic, legal system, democratic representation. One can find further confirmation of thi thesi in the splendid \\"The History of the American People\\" by British historian Paul Johnson. Samuel Huntington point out that until early sixtie immigrant arriv in the USA were assist by the government in their assimilation process. The English language instruction were easily available and no one found offensive the premise that the command of the english language wa essential to fully function a an American. Since then, the \\"assimilation\\" became a bad word and government' assistance start to look like discrimination. These days, in the name of diversity and political correctness, any government program ha a counter-assimilation effects. The bilingual education of Hispanics, for example, only postpone their entry into the English speak world. Compare the fate of Hispanic youth receiv their education in Spanish with that of young children arriv from Eastern Europe, Russia or Asia. With no bilingual education available to those kids, their succesful transition into English speak world i almost instantenous.    While discus three major social theories, Mr. Huntington clearly make a case for a \\"tomato soup with garnishings\\" model (with tomato represent anglo-protestant core value with garnishing provid by non-anglo immigrant groups). Once hop for, \\"melt pot\\" model, i not really happening. What seem to be happening, however, i that the ri cultural awarenes of individual ethnic group and lack of assimilation program lead u toward a \\"toss salad\\" type of a society.    The book raise reader' awarene of the social proceses that take place. Unfortunately, it can only do just that. The sheer force of the sociodemographic change in the US i probably impossible to control and the anglo-protestant core of value will get dillut and all but disappear.
Live on your feet or die on your knees,Mr. Andersons' book provide a thorough examination, diagnosis, and best possible cure for what ail black america. Not poor whites, hispanics, arabs, jews, gays, or white women. You owe it to you and your family to at least check out the fact of thi examination and then decide.  <br /> <br />White america ha alway put their modu operandi in our face; thi i our society, these are our rules, do the best you can with what we decide to give you; don't bother me while I make my money. If you do, the police will handle you. <br /> <br />Here i Black americas' call to focu on what should have been the legacy of civil right - economic empowerment.
Great for insight!,Thi book give a great description of what liv with Fibro i like. It help me not feel so alone with my illnes and realize that other do have similiar symptoms. If I had read thi book earlier it would have sav me from a needles bladder surgery that did more harm than good.
Honestly written!,Thi i one of the best book on how people cope with Fibro that I have read. Thi man i honest about how he feel and how he struggle in hi role a caretaker of an ill spouse. It help give me insight into what my husband must go through in help to keep me sane and well a thi illnes steal both our lives.
Great!!,I use the idea in thi book in my work with women try to break out of dysfunctional relationships. They have no clue what a real one i and how to develop one. Thi help with all type of relationship they must have.
Preposterous,Early in thi novel, our hero find out that a container of antimatter ha been hidden somewhere in the Vatican, and that if he doesn't find it in time, the city will be blown sky-high.  I could think of one obviou place the antimatter might have been stowed. I turn to my other half and said, \\"Mark my words. The antimatter will be found (insert spoiler here).\\"  <br /> <br />And, of course, it was. And so I got rather sick of Robert Langdon mis the obviou hid place and instead blunder around Rome, wast preciou time, and narrowly fail to rescue variou Church luminaries. I want to smack him--none of the cardinal ne have di if Langdon had been able to figure out the SECRET HIDING PLACE that I figur out at once.  And I'm not a Harvard professor. <br /> <br />Add to that Langdon' completely implausible escape from certain death, which wa the sort of th that only work in the movies. I'd love to see Myth Buster poke hole in that scene. Langdon would have been toast. <br /> <br />I'll leave it to other to point out hole in Brown' art history; it' been a long time since I took art history and I'll admit I'm rusty.  A for me, I'll just say that the plot manag to be both over-the-top and dull at the same time. Also, don't you just *love* Dan Brown' \\"strong\\" female character who seem to do very little other than wear skimpy clothing, get kidnapped, get rescued, and fulfill the hero' yoga-goddes fantasies? <br /> <br />Ugh.
Thi book surpris me!,Prior to read thi book, I didn't think I had major limit belief but the exercise that Cole-Whittaker take you through help me uncover some I hadn't even realiz I had. <br /> <br />If someth ha kept you from reach your potential and you can't quite figure out what, pick up thi book and uncover your personal obstacles. <br /> <br />Cole-Whittaker i a minister and doe refer to God often in the book. If that bother you, try to figure out a way to get around the reference because thi book may do wonder for you. I personally subscribe to the Higher Power so it wa fine with me.
A bles to the nations,Thi attractively illustrat book provide a showcase of Israel' achievement in field a diverse a agriculture, education, medicine, science and technology. It look at the technologies, processe and the product from thi tiny little land that are improv the live of so many people. The author highlight some of the people responsible for thi ingenuity that i benefit the whole world.<br /><br />For example, at the Weizmann Institute, Dr Michal Schwartz ha develop a way of harnes immune system cell to repair and revive damag nerve fibres. Other medical breakthrough include the miniscule camera-in-a-tablet us for internal diagnosis, ultrasound for destroy tumour and Israel' highly effective disaster relief operations.<br /><br />A great help to third world people ha been the discovery by scientist Yoel Margalith of the Bti bacterium that kill certain kind of flie and harmful mosquitoes.  Thi ha already sav million of liver and i an environment-friendly intervention.

Wonderful train book!,I saw thi book at a client' house while there to give their Lab a private lesson.  A a clicker trainer, I am usually wary of train book because so many of them give outdat advice. What a wonderful surprise thi book turn out to be! It i fill with dead-on, fabulou advice & i written in a clear, easy to read style. It i enhanc by plenty of photo and illustrations, a well. I wa particularly impress by the inclusion of item such a Calm Signals!  I highly recommend thi book for  owner of any bre dog who want to learn to train & communicate with their dog in the most effective and humane way. I plan to buy thi book to offer for sale in my dog obedience school.
Please read this, the book wa very poorly done,I feel bad say this, but I wa severely disappoint with thi book. A a physician and early American history buff I wa really look forward to learn more about Benjamin Rush.<br /><br />In general it seem that the author, despite putt out what appear to be a finished, presentable biography, never really dug into source material to find out who Benjamin Rush wa and why he wa important.  Repeatedly, we hear of Rush' fame and accomplishment and influence, but the detail are missing.<br /><br />We hear what a great doctor Rush was, consider the preeminent physician of hi times, accord to the author, but all the author write about i how Rush tortur hi patient with medical treatment we now know are harmful, such a bloodletting, giv cathartics, etc.  Rush i known a the \\"Father of American Psychiatry\\", hi book on psychiatry wa bible for many many years, and hi observation on mental illnes were in many way way way ahead of hi times...yet not a word of thi i mention except in the last ten page of thi 365 page book.  Thi subject desperately need to explained.  Thi i why he i important for heaven' sake.<br /><br />Furthermore, I think it would have been fascinat to have gotten a better feel for what bloodlett and giv cathartic wa about, we need some good old source material, firsthand observation and then-current thoughts, a well a an expose of the tool employed, etc.  Rush, it i clear, consider himself first and foremost and physician.  He dedicat hi life to the practice of medicine, he wa consider a top academic lecturer.  We are told all the top American physician for the next half century were either disciple of Rush or disciple of hi students.....but we don't really get a feel for why.<br /><br />Hi political contribution and inolvement were similarly neglected.  Although he wasn't the political calibre of Hamilton or Jefferson, he wa definitely a major player.  Much of the earlier portion of the biography seem to focu on explain the political event occurr around Rush dur the fight for independence.  The focu should have been Rush.  There' a lot of negativity surround Rush early on in the book, but how he seem to know all the important figure in the Revolution and why they respect him i not explained.<br /><br />There also weren't any picture or illustrations.  I could go on.  On the bright side, at least the book read well.  If you want to learn more about Rush, you should probably choose another book.  Sorry.
Rivet Arthurian retelling!,I have search and search for a great Arthurian retell and have been disappoint with the one I have ventur into reading. I wa somewhat skeptical when I pick up Nancy McKenzie' Queen of Camelot. Thi two-novels-in-one compilation i bas on Guenevere, from her point of view, in first person narrative, and i 623 page long in very small print. I didn't want to waste my time read someth thi big only to be disappoint at the end. I nevertheles gave the book a whirl. Glad I did! Thi i one of the most compell and beautifully told retell I have ever read! McKenzie give u a detail story about Guenevere from her point of view. She tell u about the prophecy on the day she wa born, how she spend her childhood a an adventurou tomboy, how people fear her and treat her differently a she grow up, how the knight around her battle with the Saxons, and how all of the prophecie come true. She meet Arthur, marrie him and later ha a love affair with Lancelot, someth bas on the original tale. But the novel ha so much more than that. You will see how thi story of magic, prophecies, love and betrayal transpire in an altered, detail and beautiful light. There are many twist throughout the novel.<br /><br />Guenevere i develop in such an abundant, three-dimensional way in thi novel. She i no longer just the pagan beauty who marrie a Christian, betray him and destroy all of Camelot a a result. She i a complex character with flaw a well a virtue in thi offering. Arthur i also written in a more interesting, compell way here, but it i Lancelot that once again blow me away. I have alway romanticiz Sir Lancelot and McKenzie doe not disappoint me in her version of the loyal, chivalrou knight. Merlin and Morgan Le Fay are written with much complexity and nuance a well. Thi novel, however, doe not focu so much on the love triangle between Guenevere, Arthur and Lancelot a much a her inability to supply an heir for Arthur and her affection for Arthur' bastard son, the traitorou Mordred. The overall story i magnificent. Once again, I say that McKenzie did a wonderful job bring Guenevere to life. She turn thi character into a strong, intelligent, complex, three-dimensional, flesh and blood woman, someone you will feel a great deal of affinity with. She i not portray a a simple-minded, traitorou hussy in thi one! I lov the fanciful storytell style that made me turn the page until the wee hour of the night. Some of my friend who read the book along with me complain about it be too long-winded. I didn't think it wa long-wind at all. In fact, I wish it had been longer. I lov thi book and I look forward to giv Grail Prince a whirl.for Arthur and her affection for Arthur' bastard son, the traitorou Mordred. The overall story i magnificent.

Concise and clear,I pick up thi book on a remainder table.  I had heard of Eudora Welty, only because of thi book, which won her the Pulitzer Prize. <br /> <br />I wa not dissapoint for the follow reasons: <br />1. The book i concise.  Sometime it i nice to get through a book in 3 hour rather than 3 weeks, or like some that really drag, 3 months.   <br />2. The prose i wonderful, the description colorful.  The storyline i simple, I could summarize the storyline in 3 sentence or less, but what wa remarkable wa the beauty of the writ and the short, descriptive paragraph which made me go back and reread a few which I thought were particularly poignant. <br />3. The storyline, although simple, i interesting. I could relate to Laurel; I could see the old house and recognize all the neighbor a they came to her father' wake.  I am surpris it ha not been made into a movie. (or ha it?)  <br />4. The storyline and writ style remind me of 'A Summon to Memphis\\" by Peter Taylor, another Southern writer. <br /> <br />If you are look for action packed, thi book isn't it.  Should you want to appreciate some of the finest American Literature of the 20th century, thi i a good pick.   <br />
The artifact of the great civilization of Mesoamerica and the Andes,My assumption i that a DK Eyewitnes Book entitl \\"Aztec, Inca & Maya\\" would devote section to each of the three great civilization that Spanish explorer encounter and eradicat in the 16th century.  The Aztec empire stretch between the Pacific and the Atlantic cost of Mesoamerica, the Maya kingdom wa found in the eastern part of Mesoamerica, and the Inca Empire stretch 4,000 mile along the western coast of South America.  But thi book consider the people of these region to be a mosaic of tribe and nation so that most of the chapter are topical, talk about food and drink, religiou life, masks, and such in term of all of the culture that apply.  There are a few specific chapter devot to the Inca and their ancestor and Citie of the Andes, but most tos in everyth together.<br /><br />I have to admit, I do not find thi approach to work anymore than one about Mediterranean culture that lump Spain, Italy and Greece together with the like of Portugal, Sicily, and Crete thrown in for good measure.  In thi volume the Olmecs, Teotihuacans, and Toltec are thrown in for good measure, but not so that you can have anyth close to a clear conception of the specific cultures.  There are some topic where it make sense to talk about multiple cultures, such a the Human sacrifice by the Inca and Aztecs, but that doe not apply to all of these topics.  Consequently, I am tempt to get different color highlighter and color code the three main culture throughout the book so it i easier to make the connections.<br /><br />A always, the chief attraction of thi Eyewitnes Book i that it i fill with photograph of artifact from museum around the world, from the Archaeological Museum in Lima the National Palace in Mexico City to the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Florence and the Rietberg Museum in Zurich (a subtle reminder that a lot of New World treasure made their way to Europe).  Most of u will never get to see a Toltec coyote warrior inlaid with mother-of-pearl, the Gateway of the Sun at Tiahuanaco, or a \\"teponaztli\\" (horizontal drum) in person.  \\"The Lo Angele Time Book Review\\" call one of these volume \\"Like a mini-museum between the cover of a book,\\" which i so on point that DK alway put that quote on the back.  Almost a important, Elizabeth Bauedano provide detail caption for the illustration so that you know what you are look at and what it means.  Consequently \\"Aztec, Inca & Maya\\" work better a a supplemental source than a an introduction to these fascinat civilizations.nlaid with mother-of-pearl, the Gateway of the Sun at Tiahuanaco, or a \\"teponaztli\\" (horizontal drum) in person.  \\"The Lo Angele Time Book Review\\" call one of these volume \\"Like a mini-museum between the cover of a book,\\" which i so on point that DK alway put that quote on the back.

I'm obsessed......,I'm obsess with thi book.  I had to have it when I first saw it in Border' bookstore. I ran out to Michael' Craft store that night and load up on Wilton \\"candy melts\\".  The decorat cake in thi book are fabulous.  They are not your ordinary buttercream rose cake that are a single uniform color.  They are not formal fondant cover structures. They are...well..whimsical - that i the perfect word for these cakes.  They are bright and fun and bold and artistic, deliciou and just plain amazing.  But I must admit, the melt chocolate decoration are not a easy a they appear in the book' instructions.  I'm not at all a beginner baker but thi i the first time I've made \\"art\\" with melt chocolate and mine did not look so good. I've only tri it twice though and I am go to keep trying. Hopefully I will improve. The chocolate design in thi book are the dream result I strive for.  I've sat and read thi book cover to cover about 4 time now.  I'm obsessed! The tier cake that she design can have 2 or 3 completely different pattern or color in the same cake. Sometime each tier ha a different pattern and color on each side. The color are deep and are not commonly seen on cake but on her cake they look appropriate. Usually a cake decorat book concentrate on just the actual decorat part and the recipe are not that important to the author.  Not with thi book. These recipe are excellent and easy.  Pretty basic flavor and instruction and very very good. I can't wait for the Christma season when I can attempt to make that cute light blue snowman cake. The decorat cake shown in thi book would be fun to design but they just put idea in your head for your own creation and you can just go wild with the possibilities!  I highly recommend thi book!
OK but not a good a the Illuminator,The most interest part of the book (which I really WANTED to love) wa the politic of artistry among the artists, their staff, the church and the nobles.   The love story i les interesting.  Raphael, never before in love, fall for Margherita, a baker' daughter on sight - drawn by her spirit and independence.  Onoce they become involv though, the most she doe i hang out in places/with thing he buy her, mak love to him and swoon \\"Amore Mio, Rafaello\\" and become much les interesting, so you wonder what the heck i thi love story of the century really all about? <br /> <br />Read the Illuminator instead - much more interest from start to finish
Cut yourself and then put a band-aid on...,The book i a good start point for you (and lov ones) if you're unfamiliar with liv an organic/natural/active/non-toxic lifestyle. It can be the start of a healthy journey for the rest of your and your family' life - and even SAVE your lives. You'll get start advice on design and liv a life that minimize (and likely prevents) the onset of most illnesse that seemingly require only pharmaceutical - pill popp i NOT the only solution. Isn't that the cure of all cure - prevention and healthy maintenance? Of course, there' a place for wonderful antidote and medical breakthrough like penicillin, but not ALL pharmaceutical like Vioxx are a safe a they may sound. Those are just \\"bandages\\" that don't addres the source, which can include the food you eat, the quality of the environment you surround yourself with, your physical activity, etc. <br /> <br />Even if you already have an illness, some simple lifestyle change may be all it take to reverse the condition. He mention a lot of tips, some you've heard, some you haven't. One i eat the organic equivalent of the current food you eat. Yes, organic food i a little more expensive, but how expensive i a trip to the hospital, or a visit to the doctor or lost wage due to be sick and not able to go to work. When you do the math, organic food isn't that expensive and well-worth buying. You may look into read a book called, \\"The Taste That Kills\\". And think of regular cow' milk: it' been pump with hormone and have graz in pasture treat with artificial herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides. I now drink organic milk (and may switch to soy or almond milk). And artificial sugars.. my co-worker and her husband have stopp drink diet soda and her migraine and hi lethargy are gone. <br /> <br />After mak some changes, I've stopp tak Aciphex! If you don't know, it' a drug for acid reflux. It' meant to be taken once daily, ideally for the rest of your life! I have taken it for 3 year DAILY. The independence i PRICELESS. <br /> <br />I have much more energy, more vibrancy and vitality, my skin i youthful since mak the simple change mention in the book and from my own research on the net and in books. I don't do everyth he suggest - I just took what' useful. It wasn't easy a some thing had an \\"addictive\\" pull that I had to persist through - but it' worth it. Plus, I wa annoy at first because thi isn't exactly cheap to do. I made some sacrifices; I manag my spend better. Thi small cost of treat your body/mind like gold outweigh the cost of gett sick and feel much les than ecstatic. <br /> <br />In addition, you'll get hi interest viewpoint of the motivation of the pharma's, FDA et al. I believe that justifie check thi book out... to form your own opinion, dissent or otherwise. What if... he' not mak any of thi up? He doe sound a bit fanatical about it but it ha prompt me to be aware of the possibility of the FDA, politicians, and pharmaceutical silently help each other, for example: \\"On February 10, 1993, Sen. Chafee and hi wife purchas between 2,000 and 30,000 dollar worth of stock in Merck (the giant pharmaceutical... specializ in human AND animal drugs). It just so happen that thi purchase coincide with the introduction of at least five major health-care bills. And since Sen. Chafee sit on the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Health a well a the Subcommittee on Medicare, hi purchase of Merck constitute an immediate and glar conflict of interest (motherjones).\\" <br /> <br />I think the main value of thi book i that it will help people to wake up and take charge of their health - that' a good thing! Research the thing he mention that resonate with you. Add some regular exercise and healthy food AND eliminate fast food, all soda, refin sugars, TV/microwave dinners, 10-minute oven pizzas, artificially sweeten ANYTHING, hormone milk, potatochips, cheap bread, anyth fried. If you can honestly say your life won't be better do that, then take those prescrib drug to alleviate the condition that are caus by those foods. That' like purposely cutt yourself and putt a band-aid on. You have more control over your health than you realize. Again, compare the cost of chang some of your habit to how expensive a trip to the hospital is, or a visit to the doctor or lost wage due to be sick and not able to go to work. <br /> <br />It' not a perfect how-to book, but it' a start, and a start i all you need. What' nice about thi book i that you get both a beginner' guide to consciou health and a controversial report about the FDA, pharmaceuticals, et al. The latter ha had a big influence on me, to the point where I'm go to volunteer some time to 1) educat instead of EXCLUSIVELY medicat 2) help (somehow and however small) to check and balance the powers-that-be involv with the big pharmaceuticals. <br /> <br />If you get thi book (or similar), may it start you on a healthier and happier, stress-free life.
If your child like broccoli, don't buy thi book,because he/she probably won't eat broccoli after read it.  It might be a silly reason to give a bad rat to a book, but when your child love broccoli, read a book that say broccoli i poison and should be avoided, and from that point on refuse to eat it, you don't like the book. <br /> <br />I wish author would think about thi kind of thing.
Tak JavaScript Seriously,Ajax i an unusual beast. It' not a product. It' not a standard. It' not a tool. It' not proprietary. And it' not a proper noun -- it' an acronym (although it' usually spell a if it were a proper noun).  Instead, Ajax i a collection of technique for build highly interactive Web bas application u industrial-strength JavaScript and asynchronou communications, and it' tak the Web development world by storm. Thi i one of the first book to appear on thi very hot topic, and I have to say it' a very good one. <br /> <br />\\"Foundation of Ajax\\" take you through the why and wherefore of Ajax, a well a the meat and potatoes, at a brisk pace. The example are crystal clear. One difficulty in describ Ajax application i that they're inherently multi-language -- part i alway JavaScript, and the rest i alway written in a server-side language of your choice. Choo a particular server language might have alienat some reader unfamiliar with it. Thi book neatly sidestep the problem by u fix XML file for the server component for most examples, which lead to startlingly simple descriptions. <br /> <br />A someone who ha already learn the basic of Ajax, however, I found the second half of the book even more valuable. The last few chapter talk about tool and technique for build real-life professional-grade applications. There i excellent, detail information about documenting, unit test and debugg for JavaScript, debugg Ajax communications, and u some of the newfangl Ajax framework that have begun to appear. These chapter credibly demonstrate that it' possible to treat JavaScript a a Seriou Programm Language. <br /> <br />In sum, I think that \\"Foundation of Ajax\\" i an excellent piece of work which belong on every Web developer' bookshelf.
Wake-up Call,If I didn't know better, I would think that the author of thi book had hidden camera in my pantry (and in my subconscious).  In just the first few pages, they perfectly describ my over-eat episode a if they'd been there with me while I devour an entire bag of chocolate chips.  And in the subsequent chapter they reveal the lie I've been tell myself in the back of my mind, help me get honest with myself about my distort view of my body, my eating, and how to find happiness.  Although the book i clearly aim at women in their mid-life (one of the 8 point in the plan i specific to menepause), I found most of the book applicable to me a a 30yo man who ha fluctuat between over-eat and restrict my whole life.  I feel like, for the first time in my life, a veil ha been lift that ha reveal all the ridiculou lie I've been tell myself that keep me unhappy.  I'm just start out, try to regain my ability to know when I'm really hungry (not tired, angry, bored, or depressed), and when I'm full (rather than eat until I'm sick).  I already find I'm eat more than I convinc myself I should eat (though surely les than I wa eating, since I'm not gorg on cookie anymore).  I also have more energy and find myself able to deal with work and home with a smile, rather than succumb to tension.  If you've ever told yourself that your happines i dependant on lo a few more pounds, or you've ever start eat a cake by tak a small slice, then rationaliz another small slice, then another, and another and another, until the cake i nearly gone -- thi book will be a kind, gentle wake-up call and help you take rational step toward a healthy relationship with food.
Want to be useful. But just isn't.,I thought of several different way in which to begin thi review - several witty comparison that would surely catch the reader' attention. But that wa a month and a half ago. See, I start read Blue Like Jazz on the 20th of July and it i now the 4th of October. I have four page left and I'm not sure I have the strength to continue.    For you see: Donald Miller i wearying. Endlessly self-amus and self-absorbed, he seem to want noth so much a to be hip, cool, edgy (despite hi own protest that hip, edgy, and cool are vanitie and waste of time and energy). And if four year of highschool taught me anything, it i that everyone with a heart i thoroughly and deeply embarrass when the Very Not Cool Guy walk in and trie to be cool. Think: The Offspring' \\"Pretty Fly for a White Guy.\\"    The th is: Christianity cannot be cool. There i no reason non-believer should see Christianity a anyth even on the same plane a Cool. Christianity say and believe terrify thing about the non-believer. Forget the homosexual a minute - Christianity say that the friendly, tax-paying, socially-active, community-lead paragon of virtue who doesn't bow the knee to Christ i horribly wick and an actual enemy of God. No matter how kind and cool they are. For Christianity to become cool, it ha to stop hav anyth to do with Christ and hi message. Maybe Donald Miller want that. It kinda seem like it, but who can say - since he' not that great at expres anyth beyond hi own meander and fleet feeling on matters.    About two-third into the book, a friend (who won't receive an identity via nickname, such a Tony the Beat Poet or Andrew the Protester) ask me what kind of a book it was. I had a hard time describ it at first. Then I realized: \\"OMG!! I'm read a blog on paper! LOL!!\\" Really, Miller' book i noth more than a glorifi blog in it meander promise to get to a point that never comes. In reality, Miller wouldmake a much better blogger than he doe a writer. Unfortunately, even a a blogger, he would only be so good - because despite moment of value and bit that come close to insight, hi style i heavy-hand and obviou for too much of the book' 240 page (I know, only 240 page and it' taken me almost two-and-a-half months!).     One good-but-obviou point Miller make throughout the book i that the human expression of Christianity in the contemporary American church i lack at best, gravely flaw at worst, but most likely, somewhere in between. Thi i clearly true. But also clearly known to probably most of us. And the real problem are not often the one that Miller i point out - he seem frequently upset at how little the church fit in with a world fill with lovely sinners. Yet still, there i value in hi critique.    But not much. Again Miller show himself to be like too many bloggers; and like too many bloggers, he ha much criticism and too few answers. If he were a blogger, thi might be acceptable; after all, the only cost associat with read a blog i time (and perhap mental health). A book, however, i paid in currency. There i real los if a book doe not measure up to it publish value - and Blue Like Jazz doe not. I hate to say that because there are a few amu storie and I get the feel the book want to be useful - but it just isn't.
More fact and les name-calling, please,Since you're read this, I assume you're think of buy  or at least read  thi book.  That be so, you'll probably want to read other review than mine.  Thi i in principle a good idea; but hav just read all of them (147 at the time of writing) I should warn you that you'll ne both considerable stamina and a strong stomach: there are inde thoughtful and informative reviews, but they are island in a sea of drivel.  By &#34;drivel&#34; I mean the following:<br /><br />1) Review consist entirely (or almost entirely) of expostulation rather than information (&#34;racist garbage&#34;, &#34;most important book of the 20th century&#34;)<br /><br />2) Assert what the book doesn't deny and deny what it doesn't assert.<br /><br />3) Distortion of the book' content, and other disinformation, for instance:<br /><br />  - &#34;the panel criticiz the author for not explain what intelligence is&#34; (intelligence i defin on page 4 (!) ).<br /><br />  - &#34;The Bell Curve ignore bad diet&#34; (Nutrition i explicitly dealt with on pp. 391-3).<br /><br />And so on.<br /><br />Many of the critic appear not merely to have misunderstood the book, but not even to have read it; amusingly, thi i actually admitt in one review (&#34;Although Head ha only brows through the book, she ha seen thi kind of pseudo-science before&#34;).  Some appear to be ba their argument upon the Moralistic Fallacy: if different group had different average IQ for even partially genetic reasons, it would be a Bad Thing, and therefore that cannot possibly be the case.<br /><br />(It also follows, naturally, that there' no ne to examine the evidence, because the correct outcome i known in advance; and also that those who think otherwise must be mak factual and/or logical errors, either unconsciously or consciously, mak them fool in the former case and fascist in the latter.)<br /><br />For myself, I found thi a strange book in some ways, but only one other reviewer (Jennifer Kerns, I think the name was) touch on the reason.  And that i that the book fall logically into three parts, which by their very nature are of vary reliability.<br /><br />The first, and by far the largest, cover the available evidence on IQ and heredity.  The second and third part extrapolate present trend to the future (with unpleasant consequences) and make policy recommendation to deal with these project consequences.  Thu almost by definition these are on shakier ground.<br /><br />- The first section, which excit by far the most controversy, i (ironically), easily on the firmest ground scientifically  a confirm (for example) by an American Psychological Association task force explicitly set up to investigate it*; and by a letter to the Wall Street Journal by fifty-two lead psychometricians, a copy of which can be found on the Net (&#34;Mainstream Science on Intelligence&#34;, also reprint a an appendix in H.J. Eysenck' [[ASIN:156000360X Intelligence: A New Look]]).<br /><br />It seem to me a very able summary: it define it terms, state it assumptions, produce it evidence and argue the merit of the variou theorie purport to explain it.  So there' no ne for you to take my word (or anyone's) a to whether the thesi i justified; the evidence and the argument are both there; if you're capable of rational thought, you should be able to decide for yourself.  And thi i what I advise you to do.<br /><br />- The second part envisage the potential stratification of society by intelligence into a hereditary &eacute;lite and underclass.

Exhaustive, but a few issues,Absolutely, a other reviewer have noted, thi i a book more gear toward very seriou home cook and even professional chefs.  It contain entrie on foodstuff very rarely seen on modern tables, like chill meat jellies. <br /> <br />I find the occasional technique too vague or minimally described. I also find Peterson' tone rather arrogant at times, like when he talk about the \\"right\\" consistency for some sauce that may be properly made in more than one style. <br /> <br />I also think he occasionally underseason and undersalts, and blindly repeat some mantra that simply aren't true.  He say at one point that unsalt butter i often fresher than salted.  I know that' just a \\"fact\\" that goe without say to a lot of cooks, but a anyone who' ever work in a market can tell you, it' ludicrous.  If anything, salt butter i more likely to be fresh because it sell so much quicker than unsalted.  A quick perusal of expiration date in your grocer' case will verify this.  (It' especially true with European-style butter in specialty shops, even in busy stores.)  And again, I think he undersalt frequently anyhow. <br /> <br />Not a book for the casual cook, and I wouldn't buy it for the main-dish recipes.  Thi i where you go to learn the classic technique (most of which you won't use more than a few time a year).  Can be a fun read a much a anyth else.
Read thi book to understand how far we have descended,In the middle of the 2004 presidential election campaign a report releas by the Union of Concern Scientists, endors by thousand of respect academics, accus the Bush administration of an unprecedent pattern of distortion and censorship of important scientific evidence. In typical fashion, the administration respond only when the UCS report gain media attention, and then only to dismis it a a partisan attack from the left. <br /> <br />Chri Mooney' book document in plain and incontrovertible fashion why the UCS report wa not only non-partisan truth, but significantly understat the case. The current political abuse of science i only the culmination of a consistent strategy foster by a \\"hard right\\" alliance of corporate and religiou conservative that ha gain control of the Republican party since the 1960's. <br /> <br />Corporate attack on science start with tobacco industry effort to undermine studie on the health effect of smok and second-hand smoke. The pattern laid down by the tobacco industry ha been consistently follow since: the term \\"sound science\\" and \\"junk science\\", meaningles in any scientific sense, originat with tobacco lawsuit and have been parlay by conservative into codeword for science that respectively support or threaten \\"conservative\\" ideology. <br /> <br />Mooney categorize the attack on science a fall into two main categories. The first of these i an undermin of the processe of science by suppression of information, target individual scientist (many of whom work for the government or rely on government grants), or rigg review and advisory committees. The second form these right-w attack take i through the communication proces to the public after report are released. Thi include \\"spinning\\" the science through misrepresentation or distortions, magnify uncertainty, rely on and promot fringe scientist and \\"contrarians\\", and putt scientific cloth on \\"values\\" and ideology. <br /> <br />\\"Manufactur uncertainty\\" wa a key to the tobacco industry strategy that ha been repeat again and again on issue from global warm to evolution.  Find a token scientist to magnify \\"contrarian\\" claim isn't hard: science' health come from the weather of constant attack by those who choose to think differently. But sadly there are also too many scientist will to distort their own research to conform to the ideologie of fund sources, and a disturb number of government scientist work for regulatory agencie have been encourag to alter conclusion of their reports. Mooney note the sharp distinction in conclusion on the effect of second-hand smoke between industry-fund and independent scientists. <br /> <br />It i one th to argue and make political decision bas on all the best fact available. That' what we expect our leader to do. But the right w attack on science i not satisif with the fact a they are on the environemnt, biology or medicine. Rather they seek to distort those facts, impo ideology at an earlier stage, so that decision maker and the public don't even have the truth available to them to make good decisions. <br /> <br />Many of the \\"contrarian\\" scientist who have been select by the Bush administration to sit on major oversight and advisory panel have very little research background at all. Unfortunately, science' ivory tower make it far too easy to \\"play scientist\\" for the public - there are no external credential mechanism that effectively separate real expert from impostors. Tellingly, for these political hack the argument change with time a the fact on the ground become increasingly inconvenient to their ideology. Denial of global warm become denial of human causation, now morph into assertion that global warm will be good for us. Creationism become \\"intelligent design\\". <br /> <br />The broad range of regulatory and scientific area where the same anti-science tactic have been us force the conclusion that thi i more than separate isolat incidents. Similar issue with fail intelligence on 9-11 and Iraq' WMD, and other apparent effort to conceal the fact on the ground by the administration imply thi pattern of ideological decision mak extend far beyond  the area where science i the central source of facts. <br /> <br />There are example of liberal science abuse too, where individual are tempt to spin the fact to fit their ideology. Mooney cite a few cases, but the only systematic pattern seem to be one of exaggeration of direct effect and perhap denial of uncertainty. Of the example in question, almost all show liberal statement to be much closer to the scientific fact than the right-w spin on the same issues. Even so, neither side should try to twist science to their benefit, and to hi credit Mooney doe criticize both. <br /> <br />The book ha a few flaws: there are occasional jarr repetition of previou argument that suggest chapter were rewritten several time in mid-stream, without reconsider the book a a whole. Mooney also seem reluctant to state a baldly a possible what' go on here: some people are ly about the facts, and a a result, other people are dy needlessly. Isn't there legal recourse for such fraud, a happen in the case of tobacco? <br /> <br />Mooney make a number of sensible suggestion beyond legal action: reinstate the congressional Office of Technology Assessment, pas legislation to bar political litmu test for committees, roll back the \\"sound science\\" regulatory reform that ha done so much harm. More skepticism and understand of the processe of science from journalist would be a big help, a would some reform in the science community itself.  But a he also point out, significant change will be impossible in our democracy a long a the current ideologue hold all the string of power. Gett the information out somehow and persuad the public to vote for moderate instead of ideologue i the most important th we can do - will it be enough?
Room to disagree, but unforgettable,* Joel Rosenberg i a fiction writer in the footstep of Clive Cusler, Allistair McClean, and Tom Clancy.  He lack the refinement that McClean and Clancy achieved, but not the excitement or the believability.  With the add attraction of Bible bas futurism, thi book i not only very readable, but also a bellwether of modern reality fiction.  You may disagree with the fundamental premise of thi book, but you will not regret read it.   <br />* Thi i a bold book, launch into verboten format, subject matter, and choice of protagonists.  Four page of introduction by the publisher before the title page, plott on an Old Testament prophecy, and introduc Messianic Jew into the Israeli government, the author and the publisher risk accusation of right w extremism and political incorrectnes ... and have silenc their critics. <br />* World War III i coming, and the end result i almost certain devastation.  Not only ha the old soviet Russia risen from the cloak of it own ashes, but it ha emasculat it prime enemie by brilliant and cunn propaganda and usage of subterfuge, misdirection, and infiltration.  The U.S. president i back into a corner with hi hand tied, most of America' allie have been blackmail into throw aside their cloak of friendship and forgett the lesson of World War II.  The Jew are abandon to a new holocaust, and Israel face it darkest day since Nebuchadnezzar' force carri Jerusalem away to Babylon.   <br />* But the Senior Advisor to the President, Jon Bennett, i busy on a peace mission to Moscow.  Accompani by hi long time associate and perennial date, Erin McCoy, he i unprepar for the literal firestorm which sweep him into the picture.  If there i to be a peaceful solution to thi dilemma, he i the world' last chance.  But HE FAILS. <br />* What follow i a race against time and evil.  A believable love story i the motivation for Bennett' personal involvement while hi professional involvement i motivat by the very existence of life and freedom.  There seem to be no solution for either problem.  With a sensitive but uncensor presentation of hi turmoil, the reader i drawn into hi fight by a gripp adventure that make U.S. President MacPherson, Israeli Prime Minister Doron, former head of Mossad Dr. Mordechai, and the new Russian Czar to be the support cast in a drama of the world gone berserk. <br />* Thi book i also to be commend for what it doesn't have, filthy language, bedroom scenes, and glorification of that which i evil.  It prove that a book can be sold, even if it doesn't cater to the prurient interest of a degenerate audience. <br />* That said, there are legitimate criticism of thi book.  First, by cho a modern translation of the Bible, the author ha lost much of the authority of the prophecy that would have been present had he chosen to quote the time honor K Jame Bible.  Second, while otherwise remain faithful to Biblical teaching, he stray into angelic appearance to preach the Gospel, and third, most pre-millennial prophetic scholar would agree that Mr. Rosenberg ha misplac the tim of hi prophecy.  A fourth point i the most dissappoint ommission of the role of the Roman Catholic Church.  Where the Bible point the finger of God' wrath at the city that sit on seven hills, the author redirect thi attention to an a yet unbuilt Iraqi Babylon.  Nevertheless, the impact of the fulfilment of Biblical prophecy can not be overestimated. <br />
from a lexicographer,I'm a lexicographer and computational linguist by profession -- I have very nearly read thi book (and a couple others) cover to cover. I just have to say that AH i a superior dictionary for everyday use.     I work for companie that maintain online dictionaries, and am, among other thing responsible for compar the content of these list with the latest publish dictionarie to ascertain which entrie should be delet and which new one included. I find that AH very rarely ha bad judgement with respect to selection of entries.     Perhap the reason another reviewer didn't find Carl Gaus or Reimann i because their name are actually Karl Gaus and Riemann. And I appreciate the fact that AH ha gone a long way toward rectify the perception convey by most older biographical dictionarie that all great people have been white, European and male. We ne Gaus in there of couse, but we also ne Robeson and St. Vincent Millay who won a Pulitzer Prize just like Frost, and who wrote just a beautifully.     It goal obviously i to both be a desktop dictionary in a single volume, and yet include the word that educat American speaker are likely to encounter in modern, non-technical publications. (And yes, it i an American dictionary, which i why colour i defin a 'Chiefly British, variant of color'.) Thi objective become harder and harder to achieve a the base of English-speak people expands, and the Internet make so many more thing available to the average reader. The average person may use word like 'alacrity' les often than they did 200 year ago, but in point of fact, the average person' active vocabulary i expanding.     I prefer the way they organize their word sense to what Webster does. (I never compare thing to the OED, because that i a work of art, deserv of veneration.) It reserve entirely new entrie for an entirely unrelat sense. AH will give iris(flower) and iris(of the eye) two different senses, but Webster' give (though not entirely consistently) the nominal and verbal sense of, say, 'claim' entirely different entries. AH include them under the same entry, because they are semantically very closely related.     The etymological Appendix of AH i also kind of famou among linguists. They have very nicely systematiz and cross-referenc their entrie against their hypothesiz Indo-European roots. It' quite well researched, and also a lot of fun.
Dover Edition i not Unabridged, a mark on cover,I have two copie of thi wonderful book in front of me...the Dover Juvenile Classic edition and the beautiful hardcover by Macmillan.  Not only doe the Dover edition omit all the sweet pictures, but right from the very first page it omit a sweet exchange between \\"Mr. Author\\" and an unnam interlocutor--reminiscent of the story interruption by the \\"real\\" Christopher Robin and the narrator of the Pooh stories.  If someth ha obviously been cut out right from the first page, I'd bet other passage have been cut out, too.  Perhap thi i unabridg from some version of the story, but it i definitely not the most complete text available.  Stick to the hardcover or deluxe version of the text for the real thing.
Comprehensive visual reference guide but incomplete.,At last... a comprehensive visual compendium of the most celebrat artistic promotional film market campaign worldwide... almost.  You would think that the opulent Mr. Sansweet would have in hi possession every single poster to have ever roll off the print pres for thi unprecedent franchise but several of my favorite foreign one-sheets, daybills, banner and bu stop poster are notably missing.  Doe thi mean that Mr. Sansweet ha not aquir all of them in hi enviou collection of Star War memorabilia?  Not likely.  Chance are he ha every single one of them... lock away somewhere within the bowel of hi covet archives.  Most notably absent i the lack of reference material specifically promot Revenge of the Sith and would seem to indicate that thi book wa complet and ready to be publish just prior to the film' theatrical exhibition, but there i a plethora of wonderful international promotional material such a the six character U.K. bu stop poster that are much more visually excit than the disappoint U.S. domestic ad campaign that demand to be published.  Thi can only mean that another volume must be sure to follow.  Still, there are enough international poster variation out there to keep collector like myself and presumably Mr. Sansweet himself scour the farthest reache of the globe and the galaxy for year to come.
Easy and Exciting,The book, and most especially the DVD, teach a beautiful, fast, fun, and easy technique for machine quilting.  I personally have never lik stippl a a background qult design and so wa very excit when I first saw a friend do \\"McTavishing\\".  In addition to the \\"McTavishing\\" design, Karen demonstrate about 6 other pattern includ an amazingly graceful and fairly simple Victorian Feather. The book and DVD give you all the information you ne to sit down and practice thi technique and very quickly master it.  I highly recommend it.
An amaz sequel!,If you were stunn by \\"Gridlinked,\\" and left awe-struck by \\"The Line of Polity,\\" then I guarantee you won't be disappoint with \\"Bras Man.\\" Pick up almost immediately after the end of Line, it continue the saga of ECS agent Ian Cormac, and weave narrative for many character introduc in the previou two novel - plu several fascinat new one - into an extremely satisfy whole. Best of all, it bring back one of the most unique and enigmatic of all of Asher' creation - the flaw yet noble Golem Twenty-Five, Mr. Crane.
A well-research and good book,The author wa born in Vienna but left when he wa 11.  After the war he returned, to get hi university education, and serv a a correspondent for Unit press, ABC, and Newsweek.  Thi i an account of the occupation of Austria by Hitler, and what Vienna went through while part of Nazidom.  The account of the takeover by Hitler i of high interest and well-told.  The account of the war year i also well done but it wa not a interesting.  In the final chapter Weyl give a good account of Austria since the war, and show that many Austrian exaggerate their resistance to Hitler. Thi i a book well worth read if you want to know about Austria' fall and the dreary war year in Vienna, and the post-war course of Austria.  One i glad that so much that wa destroy in the war ha been reconstituted.
A Thoughtful and Enjoyable Look Backstage at the Opera,For the operaholic among u (I am one) \\"Fortissimo\\" i an entertain and interest look at what goe on backstage at the opera. Author Murray wa given unprecedent acces to Lyric Opera of Chicago' Opera Center for American Artist dur the 2003-2004 season. Thi i Lyric Opera' train ground for young artists. Murray follow thi group of twelve singer through coach sessions, rehearsals, audition and performance to give the reader a close-hand look at the rigorou intensity of thi most gloriou art form. Interspers with thi are chapther which fill out the picture of what it take to succe in opera. There i a chapter devot to the comprimario - singer who specialize in secondary characters. Another chapter i devot to Pavarotti, a warn of what can happen when one achieve what Murray dub 'sacr monster' status. A sacr monster, superstar, Pavarotti wa undone at the end of hi career by hi enormou ego. Thi book i a wonderful gift for those opera lover on your Christma list thi season.
hopeful, but....,Eloquently argu thesi for why peace in the middle east i not only possible, but in the best interest of all the people who live there. Unfortunately, I feel that the premise are naive and the entire arguement fail when one consider that Hama and the other rejectionist group will never accept Israel' existence, no matter how much Israel i will to compromise. That a huge number of Palestinian (majority?) agree with the \\"terrorists'\\" position and hate Jew and will never accept the concept of giv away any \\"holy\\" Arab land leave hope for peace quite impotent. The book make logical sense, but passion do not respond to logic, especially in the middle east.
A Great Example of Human Thought 50 Year Ahead of it Time!,My first reaction to the sight of yet another groundbreaking, landmark book by proces theologian David Ray Griffin wa one of frank astonishment. I have never seen such overwhelm intellectual power and creativity in the hand of any one individual--ever.<br /><br />Moreover, the quality of hi material i typically so far ahead of it time, time and time again, that we should feel fortunate in the extreme to have yet another incredible document \\"from the future\\" here with now, thank to the truly relentles effort of David Ray Griffin.
Great book for color knitting, men' knitwear & plu sizes,I just receiv thi book a couple of day ago but I am already enchant and can't wait to get start on some of the patterns. I have fallen in love with handpaint yarn and thi book offer some great idea for their use. The pattern are great and the photography i wonderful. Best of all it include many pattern for men in 1x and 2x. Be a guy with a large frame I am continuosly upset with pattern designer who only offer a smatter of male pattern and those are usually for men of slight frame. I also like color in my garment and most male pattern are dark solid colors. Thi book offer a new look at u color for any gender. I don't know where one of the previou poster saw all the fair isle. It doe include some, but the majority of pattern use color in a variety of other ways. Oh, it also ha a lot of great pattern for women.

It's About Time,The Georgia Straight's Lucas Aykroyd reviewed Van Halen 101 in this month's issue. During what was an overall positive review, he managed to write one line that perfectly summed up the book.    \\"This is a book about dudes, by a dude, written for other dudes.\\"    That one line says it all. Lucas got it. Just like the author got it. Mr. Sanchez may be just a \\"fan\\" to some, but this \\"fan\\" managed to do for Van Halen what no one else, be it fan or professional, has ever done for the band in their entire history. It's about time. Mr. Sanchez put together a fun, interesting, accurate book with a beautiful tribute to Eddie Van Halen. And since the band has never written their own story, and at this point likely never will, this will be as good as it gets.    Up until this point, the only written material we'd received from Van Halen \\"fans\\" never made the passing grade. I've been a VH fan since the band debuted and I own everything ever written about them. Back in the nineties there was even some VH fanzine called \\"The Inside.\\" It was by some fan and his buddies. Other than the fact it had really nice pics, it was a typical fanzine written by what appeared to be some college guys with one too many VH posters on their wall. Not exactly a bastion of journalism or something people will seek out years from now. At best, a minor blip on the radar screen.     Then there was the Van Halen Encyclopedia, a collaborative effort by hundreds of fans. It was a fine effort, but this too fell short. It's really just a journal of VH info listed alphabetically. Not the most exciting read. More the cure for insomnia.    Van Halen 101 got it right and goes light years beyond anything that has ever been written on the band. As Lucas said, \\"a book about dudes, by a dude, written for other dudes.\\" This ain't Motley Crue's \\"The Dirt.\\" And really, who would want to waste their money on a bunch of fiction dressed up nicely by Neil Strauss? Unlike \\"The Dirt,\\" Van Halen 101 is legit and positive andfocuses on what is truly important. No time to waste here with \\"inside scoops.\\" Fans who sit around drooling and waiting for that type of stuff need to get a life. Mr. Sanchez shows integrity by not relying on that type of material.     With Van Halen 101, what you see is what you get. No where on this book does the word \\"biography\\" appear. Ever. Not once. It has never been marketed or labeled as such. While it does contain plenty of biographical information on the band, the book is presented as a \\"comprehensive guide to the amazing history, music, impact and influence of the Mighty VH.\\" It says so, clear as day, on the back cover of Van Halen 101. So the author and publisher have never presented this as a \\"biography\\", nor have they ever claimed to have \\"inside scoops\\" or anything of that sort. It's clearly stated the book is a comprehensive guide.    One of the best and easiest ways to determine a book's worth and status is to compare it to other books about the same subject. Just compare Van Halen 101 with the other VH book released in 2005, Backbeat Books \\"Eddie Van Halen: Know the Man, Play the Music.\\" Talk about night and day, Van Halen 101 demolishes that book. Absolutely crushed it. The funny thing is that \\"Eddie Van Halen: Know the Man, Play the Music\\" was written by a \\"professional\\" writer named Malcolm Dome. Yes, Malcolm is a music journalist who also wrote another Van Halen book called \\"Excess in All Areas\\" back in the nineties. By the way, \\"Excess in All Areas\\" is awful, too.    Meanwhile, Van Halen 101 was written and entirely put together by a \\"fan.\\" Well, this \\"fan\\" knows more about VH than a thousand Malcolm Domes, that's for sure.     Van Halen 101 is well worth the money. There is simply nothing out there in book form about Van Halen that comes anywhere close to it. Until the band members get off their duffs and put something together, this is THE Van Halen book.

Not exactly a bastion of journalism or something people will seek out years from now. At best, a minor blip on the radar screen.     Then there was the Van Halen Encyclopedia, a collaborative effort by hundreds of fans. It was a fine effort, but this too fell short. It's really just a journal of VH info listed alphabetically. Not the most exciting read. More the cure for insomnia.    Van Halen 101 got it right and goes light years beyond anything that has ever been written on the band. As Lucas said, \\"a book about dudes, by a dude, written for other dudes.\\" This ain't Motley Crue's \\"The Dirt.\\" And really, who would want to waste their money on a bunch of fiction dressed up nicely by Neil Strauss? Unlike \\"The Dirt,\\" Van Halen 101 is legit and positive andfocuses on what is truly important. No time to waste here with \\"inside scoops.\\" Fans who sit around drooling and waiting for that type of stuff need to get a life. Mr. Sanchez shows integrity by not relying on that type of material.     With Van Halen 101, what you see is what you get. No where on this book does the word \\"biography\\" appear. Ever. Not once. It has never been marketed or labeled as such. While it does contain plenty of biographical information on the band, the book is presented as a \\"comprehensive guide to the amazing history, music, impact and influence of the Mighty VH.\\" It says so, clear as day, on the back cover of Van Halen 101. So the author and publisher have never presented this as a \\"biography\\", nor have they ever claimed to have \\"inside scoops\\" or anything of that sort. It's clearly stated the book is a comprehensive guide.    One of the best and easiest ways to determine a book's worth and status is to compare it to other books about the same subject. Just compare Van Halen 101 with the other VH book released in 2005, Backbeat Books \\"Eddie Van Halen: Know the Man, Play the Music.\\" Talk about night and day, Van Halen 101 demolishes that book. Absolutely crushed it. The funny thing is that \\"Eddie Van Halen: Know the Man, Play the Music\\" was written by a \\"professional\\" writer named Malcolm Dome. Yes, Malcolm is a music journalist who also wrote another Van Halen book called \\"Excess in All Areas\\" back in the nineties. By the way, \\"Excess in All Areas\\" is awful, too.    Meanwhile, Van Halen 101 was written and entirely put together by a \\"fan.\\" Well, this \\"fan\\" knows more about VH than a thousand Malcolm Domes, that's for sure.     Van Halen 101 is well worth the money. There is simply nothing out there in book form about Van Halen that comes anywhere close to it. Until the band members get off their duffs and put something together, this is THE Van Halen book.

It's About Time,The Georgia Straight's Lucas Aykroyd reviewed Van Halen 101 in this month's issue. During what was an overall positive review, he managed to write one line that perfectly summed up the book.    \\"This is a book about dudes, by a dude, written for other dudes.\\"    That one line says it all. Lucas got it. Just like the author got it. Mr. Sanchez may be just a \\"fan\\" to some, but this \\"fan\\" managed to do for Van Halen what no one else, be it fan or professional, has ever done for the band in their entire history. It's about time. Mr. Sanchez put together a fun, interesting, accurate book with a beautiful tribute to Eddie Van Halen. And since the band has never written their own story, and at this point likely never will, this will be as good as it gets.    Up until this point, the only written material we'd received from Van Halen \\"fans\\" never made the passing grade. I've been a VH fan since the band debuted and I own everything ever written about them. Back in the nineties there was even some VH fanzine called \\"The Inside.\\" It was by some fan and his buddies. Other than the fact it had really nice pics, it was a typical fanzine written by what appeared to be some college guys with one too many VH posters on their wall.

It's About Time,The Georgia Straight's Lucas Aykroyd reviewed Van Halen 101 in this month's issue. During what was an overall positive review, he managed to write one line that perfectly summed up the book.    \\"This is a book about dudes, by a dude, written for other dudes.\\"    That one line says it all. Lucas got it. Just like the author got it. Mr. Sanchez may be just a \\"fan\\" to some, but this \\"fan\\" managed to do for Van Halen what no one else, be it fan or professional, has ever done for the band in their entire history. It's about time. Mr. Sanchez put together a fun, interesting, accurate book with a beautiful tribute to Eddie Van Halen. And since the band has never written their own story, and at this point likely never will, this will be as good as it gets.    Up until this point, the only written material we'd received from Van Halen \\"fans\\" never made the passing grade. I've been a VH fan since the band debuted and I own everything ever written about them. Back in the nineties there was even some VH fanzine called \\"The Inside.\\" It was by some fan and his buddies. Other than the fact it had really nice pics, it was a typical fanzine written by what appeared to be some college guys with one too many VH posters on their wall. Not exactly a bastion of journalism or something people will seek out years from now. At best, a minor blip on the radar screen.     Then there was the Van Halen Encyclopedia, a collaborative effort by hundreds of fans. It was a fine effort, but this too fell short. It's really just a journal of VH info listed alphabetically. Not the most exciting read. More the cure for insomnia.    Van Halen 101 got it right and goes light years beyond anything that has ever been written on the band. As Lucas said, \\"a book about dudes, by a dude, written for other dudes.\\" This ain't Motley Crue's \\"The Dirt.\\" And really, who would want to waste their money on a bunch of fiction dressed up nicely by Neil Strauss? Unlike \\"The Dirt,\\" Van Halen 101 is legit and positive andfocuses on what is truly important. No time to waste here with \\"inside scoops.\\" Fans who sit around drooling and waiting for that type of stuff need to get a life. Mr. Sanchez shows integrity by not relying on that type of material.     With Van Halen 101, what you see is what you get. No where on this book does the word \\"biography\\" appear. Ever. Not once. It has never been marketed or labeled as such. While it does contain plenty of biographical information on the band, the book is presented as a \\"comprehensive guide to the amazing history, music, impact and influence of the Mighty VH.\\" It says so, clear as day, on the back cover of Van Halen 101. So the author and publisher have never presented this as a \\"biography\\", nor have they ever claimed to have \\"inside scoops\\" or anything of that sort. It's clearly stated the book is a comprehensive guide.    One of the best and easiest ways to determine a book's worth and status is to compare it to other books about the same subject. Just compare Van Halen 101 with the other VH book released in 2005, Backbeat Books \\"Eddie Van Halen: Know the Man, Play the Music.\\" Talk about night and day, Van Halen 101 demolishes that book. Absolutely crushed it. The funny thing is that \\"Eddie Van Halen: Know the Man, Play the Music\\" was written by a \\"professional\\" writer named Malcolm Dome. Yes, Malcolm is a music journalist who also wrote another Van Halen book called \\"Excess in All Areas\\" back in the nineties. By the way, \\"Excess in All Areas\\" is awful, too.    Meanwhile, Van Halen 101 was written and entirely put together by a \\"fan.\\" Well, this \\"fan\\" knows more about VH than a thousand Malcolm Domes, that's for sure.     Van Halen 101 is well worth the money. There is simply nothing out there in book form about Van Halen that comes anywhere close to it. Until the band members get off their duffs and put something together, this is THE Van Halen book.

It' About Time,The Georgia Straight' Luca Aykroyd review Van Halen 101 in thi month' issue. Dur what wa an overall positive review, he manag to write one line that perfectly summ up the book.    \\"Thi i a book about dudes, by a dude, written for other dudes.\\"    That one line say it all. Luca got it. Just like the author got it. Mr. Sanchez may be just a \\"fan\\" to some, but thi \\"fan\\" manag to do for Van Halen what no one else, be it fan or professional, ha ever done for the band in their entire history. It' about time. Mr. Sanchez put together a fun, interesting, accurate book with a beautiful tribute to Eddie Van Halen. And since the band ha never written their own story, and at thi point likely never will, thi will be a good a it gets.    Up until thi point, the only written material we'd receiv from Van Halen \\"fans\\" never made the pas grade. I've been a VH fan since the band debut and I own everyth ever written about them.

Great book for color knitt  men' knitwear & plu sizes,I just receiv thi book a couple of day ago but I am already enchant and can't wait to get start on some of the patterns. I have fallen in love with handpaint yarn and thi book offer some great idea for their use. The pattern are great and the photography i wonderful. Best of all it include many pattern for men in 1x and 2x. Be a guy with a large frame I am continuosly upset with pattern designer who only offer a smatter of male pattern and those are usually for men of slight frame. I also like color in my garment and most male pattern are dark solid colors. Thi book offer a new look at u color for any gender. I don't know where one of the previou poster saw all the fair isle. It doe include some, but the majority of pattern use color in a variety of other ways. Oh, it also ha a lot of great pattern for women.
A bad nite for the favorite teams: Astros and Spartans lose.  The nite out with T.W. was good."
